SkywalkerPL (talk) 10:42, 23 August 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n@SkywalkerPL: I'm going to  object to your statement there. There is no high-quality colour image besides this one. The only other decent-quality colour image is File:Oscar Niemeyer.jpg, but he is over 100 years old in that image, and it hardly reflects what he looked like during his career. And, of the black-and-white images of him, the largest is 686 × 974 pixels. Further, the copyright status of said black-and-white images, upon checking, is almost certainly a copyright violation. The very description says they weren't taken in Italy.  Your statement is simply false. Adam Cuerden (talk) 17:10, 23 August 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nFair enough about suspected copyvio. Still though I really doubt that such a poor quality photograph is the only one that could possibly be obtained for wikipedia out of his long career, especially considering that some of the photographs of him very likely fall under public domain in Italy. I really doubt if this is one of these cases where we got hold on irreplaceable photograph that therefore would be satisfying enough for featured picture. I still would say that it doesn't fulfil the criteria of Is of a high technical standard, so I'll uphold my vote. I understand your nomination, in my humble opinion it's in this gray area between FP and not an FP. But for me it's just too low quality with too much potential of obtaining higher quality image to pass as a FP.",

Brandmeistertalk 13:39, 5 October 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n@Brandmeister:, it is a Commons Featured Picture. It was Picture of the Day on Wikimedia Commons. It was even a candidate in Commons Picture of the Year 2008. It's been the Coat of arms of Mexico since 1968. It's used on over-one-hundred pages on English Wikipedia. Surely this has high Encyclopedic Value. Not sure why we wouldn't feature it? — Cirt (talk) 16:25, 5 October 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nThat's ok and I like this particular coat of arms. But there are over 200 other coats of arms of sovereign nations with the same encyclopedic value, so from an encyclopedic point of view there's no compelling reason to outline this one.

I am inclined to go with the Original as nominated by image creator. Bammesk (talk) 00:47, 22 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\n@Bammesk: You can't tell on the handles? It's glaringly different to me. Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 8.9% of all FPs 08:04, 22 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nYes it is sharper, and I agree with your general point. In this composition, with six somewhat monotonic monochromatic files, the extra sharpness doesn't have much of a punch or overall effect. It would be different if the subject was a landscape or a portrait. But I am not too attached and would support Alt if consensus goes in that direction.

      "Oppose PNG, Support JPEG I just don't think Wikipedia's software handles PNGs well enough to make them viable, and years of me attempting to get it fixed have failed. Compare how the company name is clearly visible on the JPEG, and not at all on the PNG, for instance, and likewise the texture of the file itself, particularly on the second and fourth. It's just a lower-quality thumbnail that isn't appropriate for FP unless someone actually fixes it. Which no-one is willing to do.  Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 8.9% of all FPs 11:31, 22 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\n@Adam Cuerden what gets featured is the image file itself, which doesn't have any problems. Also the PNG version has much more value because of the cut out background and lossless compression. So in your opinion no more PNG files can get featured, no matter what, just because of display issues in thumbnail generation which the creators are not to blame for? Please reconsider. I understand thumbnails are important but anyone remotely interested in the image will examine the file itself anyway and not stop altogether at a slightly blurry thumbnail.  – Lucas 17:46, 22 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nEspecially since thumbnails in articles usually are only 200 or 300 px wide. If you want to see detail, you have to click to the image page. In full size, I see no discernible difference except for the shade of the background. --Janke | Talk 19:22, 22 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\n@Lucasbosch and Janke: I see two problems with this: Firstly, sure, we may turn Media Viewer off, but it's a default, and the image won't look the same until you get to the full resolution version, which requires going through Media Viewer to the File description page, THEN downloading the full-size version. Secondly, having put thumbnail versions side by side (see above) I'd say the JPEG was noticably a little better, particularly the second, third and fourth, which show a little more shape and detail, and  a lot more of the original's variations in tone.

      "Support High EV in both showing the use of a public address system, the uniform of a rear admiral, and add to that, the notability of the particular rear admiral shown in this case. Well caught moment. One issue is that the face of the speaker is somewhat under-exposed, because there is a bright background. That is for me mitigated by the very high EV. The background is also great at visualizing with good bokeh the action on-board the ship. -- Slaunger (talk) 15:48, 16 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

I used f4.5 to have a more blurred background and to enhance a sense of volume in the owl itself. A very blurred background was necessary to isolate the owl so it looked more like an encyclopaedic portrait, the bush behind is not so far. Choosing of the point of view followed the same reasons: if I had been standing or at owl's level, too much distracting ground would be seen. Being slightly below his eyes allowed me to see some sky and to give even more protagonism to the owl. --Kadellar (talk) 16:54, 13 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]"

Cache partitioning is a feature in most modern browsers that preventcache timing attacks(a type ofCross-site leak) from occuring. Before the introduction of Cache partitioning, an attacker could gain information about a different site (say Gmail) by checking how long a particular image took to load. If a image took a small amount of time to load, the attacker could infer that the image was previously used by the website (since the image would be stored in theWeb cache). Similarly, if the image took too long to load, a attacker could infer that the image had not been previously loaded by the other website. With cache partitioning, both a cached image and an uncached image from a different site will take approximately the same amount of time to resolve blocking this kind of information leakage.",

Coat of Many Colours (talk) 09:56, 9 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nreply It is correct it has been cropped from an original 16 Mpixels down to a little over 7 Mpixels. Yet that is still well above the minimum file size. When photographing relatively fast moving object while panning, I tend to zoom out a bit as it can be hard to exactly frame the object as intended the moment things happens, and it is then easier to crop a bit afterwards. This aircraft only landed once, so it was the only chance I had. I think the less-than-optimal resolution is compensated by excellent light.

      "Oppose. It's a good view but the image quality is poor. I'm shocked that ISO 320 is so noisy. And there is a lot of chromatic aberration, particularly on the left side. Was it taken through a window? Ðiliff «» (Talk) 23:40, 17 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nIt was taken through the open window port in the helicopter. It is not on a gimbal so the small helicopter creates a great deal of vibration, that I as a airplane pilot was not expecting. I have about 50 images from the sequence, I will review to see of others had less vibration clutter. talk→ WPPilot  02:13, 18 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nIf there is no glass between your lens and the subject and you're getting that much chromatic aberration then I have to restate what I've mentioned in your previous nominations - I think your lens is faulty. Far too many of your shots are soft, and particularly blurry at the edges, particularly on one side. I don't know if you're always using the same lens or a variety of lenses, but I do recall you saying that you were using a high quality lens when I mentioned this in another nomination. I honestly can't think what else could be causing such poor optical performance. I know that it's a tough environment to shoot in, but it's not just the effect of vibration. Perhaps a lot of consistent vibration over time has damaged the lens in some way? Just a thought. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 11:19, 18 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

It is, in fact, a great demonstration as to how the formal concept of a rule of thirds may not be applied by an artist who dares challenge it. What we have here is a painting divided precisely down the middle by a lamppost, separating the near from the far. This division is then further divided into quarters. The face of the young woman is in the middle of the right side, both horizontally and vertically. In the left side, a small distant couple occupies the same position, one quarter of the way across the painting. The single notable object that occupies a \"thirds\" position is the umbrella that shelters the righthand couple. It is all very tidy, very challenging and a little surreal.

I support removing the small branch. Bammesk (talk) 18:33, 9 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nLet's ask JJH to clone out ihe stick in his RAW file, right? When done, I'll support. --Janke | Talk 13:43, 10 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nHowever, neither of those clones affected the main subject, which is a significant difference.  FP criteria say, \"Any manipulation which causes the main subject to be misrepresented is unacceptable.\"  While \"misrepresented\" is obviously subjective, cloning out the branch would mean featuring a picture where part of the subject was in fact cloned from elsewhere (perhaps in ways that subtly misrepresent the subject). This seems inadvisable to me. TSP (talk) 13:03, 12 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nThere's room for reasonable disagreement here, but I don't think that that \"part of the subject [being] cloned from elsewhere\" necessarily implies that the subject is being \"misrepresented\". I think a change would be relatively innocuous - indeed, given the potential for confusion as to what is and isn't part of the duck's bill, I think cloning could here reduce confusion, and thus (inadvertent) misrepresentation. Josh Milburn (talk) 13:40, 12 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI'll have a crack at it soon. There seems to be some precedent for cloning in for e.g. digital restorations. JJ Harrison (talk) 00:30, 13 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nFor me, the cloning is not needed here. The twig is on the bird rather than being in the background. Charlesjsharp (talk) 09:15, 13 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nIMO, clonong is needed. Otherwise, you'd think that the strange shape of the bill is just mud or other stuff.

      "Oppose retouched, neutral original - it's a good photo, but I'd argue that if a reasonably reproducible shot can't be featured without cloning in part of the main subject, it probably shouldn't be featured - a photo where part of the thing depicted is fake falls short of being the best of Wikipedia photography. (This is distinct from restorations, where it isn't possible to retake the shot and a restoration gives the best possible version.) TSP (talk) 16:54, 14 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nThe stick thing arrived there from feeding, so I think it has some EV. As far as me getting another photo without one, I would most likely need to get on a plane and visit another part of Australia. Per the article they're only nomadic visitors to my part of the country. This was the case in Tasmania too where I last saw one in 2011! JJ Harrison (talk) 19:25, 14 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI sympathise; and it's certainly a good, valuable, encyclopedic shot, and if editors feel that it's featurable with the stick in place, that's great. If editors feel that the stick needs to be edited out, my feeling is that moves it below featurable standard. Not that it's not a great shot; but featured images should be the very best, most encyclopedically-valuable possible works among the 50 million images available to Wikipedia; and in my view, if part of the main subject of a potentially (even if not trivially) reproducible photo has had to be faked to make up for a perceived problem, that moves it below that bar. TSP (talk) 16:34, 15 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI beg to disagree. The removal of the twig has made the bill shape clear; originally I thought the edge of the bill was mud! Besides, if JJH had shot the picture a few seconds before the duck got the twig on its bill, we'd have a photo just like the retouched one. Removing something confusing that isn't a part of the duck increases EV, IMO. --Janke | Talk 22:07, 16 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]",

This just happens to show some computer waste, but it otherwise looks like a regular junkyard. There are car parts (doors, tires) and household waste (desk, probably also a refrigerator) present as well and the computer parts make roughly only half of the image. Also, the colorful shed attracts too much attention in an rather dark picture. --Ebertakis (talk) 20:32, 11 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

This shows how computers are recycled in one situation. It shows how people live and work, in this situation. The topic is not \"computer recycling\".  That is merely one aspect of what is shown here. Amandajm (talk) 03:02, 12 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThe place is notable because it is \"known as a destination for legal and illegal exportation and environmental dumping of electronic waste\" according to the first sentence of its article. The picture is also used in Computer recycling, Data erasure and Electronic waste. This is why I assumed that the EV lies in \"computer recycling\" and I thought the picture does a poor job showing this. Thousands of communities around the world are near garbage heaps, and their issues deserve attention, but I didn't get that message because I was looking in the picture for the computers. If the topic is the living conditions then the other picture in the article is much more powerful. Anyway, I switched to neutral because I'm new here, but this is how I saw things. --Ebertakis (talk) 22:52, 12 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]"

I believe the original benefits from the additional context; I think that the original gives us a better idea of how the house fits in with the grounds, yet the house is still prominent and dominant in the frame. I like the framing of the original better, with the two tallest trees on either side (the crop has weaker framing on the left). My eyes are drawn to the clean expanses of sky and grass that exist in the original but are truncated in the crop. I like how, in the original, you get a more complete view of the cloud formation above the house, almost forming a halo above. I feel like the additional context amplifies this building's majesty. To me, the building seems more profound and more important in the original, perhaps because there is more extra space around it, space that seems to serve the building. The extra degrees of perspective also helps remind me where Monticello is in the world and gives me that much more confidence that there are no skyscrapers lurking in the background to challenge the space.

      "Oppose. The photographer really needs to clean his DSLR sensor. It's extremely dirty. As for the image itself, I'm not convinced though. It has some EV in showing the kit of a 'rescue swimmer' but it seems designed to be a bit of a propaganda portrait more than really being that useful for the article. An image showing someone in action would be more useful. If the article was about her as a notable person, it might have more EV, but otherwise it's a bit limited. The lighting is also quite poor (overexposed sky and underexposed black kit) and the WB seems off. It could be because of the light through the clouds, but it seems too pink-tinted for me.

It's the other way around, the one with writing was \"edited\" at the time the print was made - the area was dodged out during printing, to leave space for a hand-written note. Proof: put both images in their own tabs, switch between them. You can see that the one with the writing has the floor lightened, but the same floor details are there in both versions. Do it and you see why I support. --Janke | Talk 21:48, 6 March 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nI see what you mean, but can we be sure that there is no version with the original floorboards? That seems unlikely.

It's also not a show with a lot of illustration options. It's possible I could find some of the 1891 benefit or the 1892 short run, but whether they'd be particularly worthwhile is hard to say. Known drawings do not bode well (Though I'm pretty sure that's Hamlet's speech to the players, which is at least a significant moment; mind, the current suggestion is the performance itself that the play centres around.)

      "Comment. While I'm not going to insist that the image be completely perspective-corrected, because doing so may distort the building too much, but did the alt actually correct it at all? To me, it looks like the building's vertical lines are mostly corrected on the right side, but leans inwards significantly on the left side. In other words, you would need to rotate the image counter-clockwise so that both sides are leaning inwards equally, then correct the vertical perspective. But does the building lean inwards by design? I just wanted to ask, because I didn't want to assume that they should be completely vertical. Also, normally I wouldn't suggest downsampling, but the image is fairly soft at 100% and I think you could safely downsample to say 8000x5300 without a loss of actual detail. It would still be very high res but would be more manageable to download, as 50mb is a bit large.

I put together a quick image to show you the lean (and other significant issues I discovered while looking closer). Rather than clog Commons up with it, I figured I'd upload it somewhere temporarily so you can see what I'm referring to. Click the 'download' button to view the full size image for more detail (I downsized it to 5000x3300 but you can still see the issues clearly at that resolution, and much more obviously at full resolution). It's based on the original image rather than the alt, but both images have the same issues to varying degrees.  I suspect these issues were introduced to the image prior to stitching, as I can see that some of the artifacts have actually been distorted by the stitching process so that they are no longer 'rectangular'. I would suggest you go back to the original files, and do any processing work with them as TIF files until you're finally ready to 'save for the web'. This is good practice and minimises the chance of introducing any of these kinds of issues.",

      "Support, but I sense a slight tilt to the left. Is it fixable? Brandmeistertalk 13:21, 15 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThere might be an ever so slight tilt to the left. However, if you're judging it from the fact that the window arches are not both meeting at the exact corner of the frame, that would give you an exaggerated sense of tilt, as any deviations from horizontal are accentuated there due to the extremely wide point of view. It could also be because the building is not absolutely symmetrical, or that I haven't taken the photo from the precise centre of the hall. I tried to rotate the image so that identical objects on either side of room were horizontal and parallel, but that ended up making the windows tilt even more noticeably. If there is indeed a need for some sort of correction, it's likely a complex and minute perspective correction and not a simple tilt. To be honest, I don't think it's worth the trouble. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 18:13, 15 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nAh, ok. The tilt may be noticed by comparing the bar betwen the portraits and the front window with a straight line, in particular. I gave the image a 0,49 deg clockwise rotation in PS (without upload), but, as usually, several pixels would go in that case. Brandmeistertalk 20:10, 15 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

Charlesjsharp (talk) 12:40, 7 November 2018 (UTC)[reply]\n@Charlesjsharp: Although this looks a bit like a tarantula, it's actually a tiny jumping spider (about the size of a house fly). With a macro photo of something so small it isn't possible to have both better sharpness and DoF (due to diffraction softening). f/11 (the aperture setting that was used) is right in the sweet spot for an SLR sensor. If you pushed it to f/16 (for more DoF) it would be diffraction limited and start looking soft. Personally, I think the photographer made a good trade-off between DoF and sharpness as most of the spider is in focus, especially the part closest to the viewer.

Is it just that it is issued in Oslo even though it has Dansk specified as the type?) Belle (talk) 15:57, 6 August 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nBelle- An excellent question (which made me sweat for a moment). The Danish 5 Rigsdaler Courant from 1807 looks notably different regarding design features (i.e., visibly different, has an anti-counterfeiting text vertically in the right margin, and was printed on blue paper). The images of other notes from this series are illustrated in the main reference book for world currency (that does not mean they are immune from making errors), under Norway. I do believe that the place (city) of printing/issuance plays a major factor in determining the origin of the note. For example, in the Norway section of the reference, a single denomination within a series of Norwegian notes was printed and issued from Copenhagen (24 Skilling of 1810), and it is listed in the Denmark section of the book. Can I enlist your assistance in translating the description above in the image file?--Godot13 (talk) 18:14, 6 August 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nOK, that makes sense. Support.

      "Comment This gives me the opportunity to raise a question I had, which is whether the picture really needs correction? Those may be paint loss and defects in the painting as it currently is, rather than defects in the photograph of the painting. Especially given that the painting is used in art articles, shouldn't we reproduce the painting, rather than trying to \"correct\" it as we might do with some illustrations for articles? It seems that a reproduction of a painting should represent the painting and be clearly labeled in the article caption if it's been \"improved\".--Jahaza (talk) 23:22, 31 July 2023 (UTC)[reply]",

It doesn't explain anything at all about what the process involves, whereas a video much more clearly does. The ice bucket challenge, from the videos I've seen, is rather ritualistic (thank the nominator for nominating you, nominate three others, discuss ALS to some degree, etc) and the physical pouring of the bucket is just one part of the meme.

      "Oppose In this stance, as opposed to a side-on view, too much of the bird is concealed to allow identification. A good taxobox image should aid identification; however, anyone who's looked at Passeriformes will tell you there are many birds that look similar to the one presented here in all the visible detais except perhaps the tail (I'd have to double-check) - even then, the length of the tail is hard to guesstimate from the picture. Almost any other picture on the internet shows the upperside, with its distinctive, diagnostic markings. Of the reasonable-resolution images on Commons, this, this and this serve as better examples for identification.

Most early morning shots I've seen have the smaller northwest prang in the shadow of the central one, and by the time the sun rises high enough for the shadow to subside the light becomes pretty much too harsh. There are probably a few months where the sun rises at just the right azimuth to create the perfect lighting, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

I realize that the art of portraiture hadn't been well developed in 1897, but it wasn't a completely new concept. Here are some examples of compelling portrait photographs from the same year: 1, 2, 3. I realize this is a very subjective opinion, so I'm marking it as 'weak'. Kaldari (talk) 19:16, 12 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n@Kaldari: Personally, I find this portrait much more natural than the usual rigid pose. That also may  be due to Tolstoy's personality. It is also notable that this is not taken in a studio with controlled light, but in the open with a natural light and environment, and that's quite rare for that period. I find it odd that you think this is a reason for opposing. Just my 2 Rs. Yann (talk) 18:44, 13 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n@Yann: It does look natural, but almost snapshot natural.

Kaldari (talk) 20:31, 13 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n@Kaldari: Well Tolstoy was so much out of phase with his time that it is difficult to say if this was a \"natural pose\". He was critical of almost everything the society valued. To me, he looks a bit tense. I can imagine that he felt compelled to be photographed without being completely at ease. I hope I am clear. Obviously I would prefer that you support, but that's your choice. ;o) Yann (talk) 22:25, 13 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nI think if the lighting were better or the DOF more shallow it would make Tolstoy stand out more (and look more dramatic).

      "Support - A great image! One can see many details, even of things in the distance, and the view includes a great deal of the interior of the church. Also, the vantage point just slightly off a direct view up the center aisle makes the picture interesting -- or is it slightly off? Now I'm not sure. Well, I like it anyway. CorinneSD (talk) 20:09, 7 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThanks! Actually, it's not off centre. At least, it shouldn't be, and if it is, it's only very slight. I find that the centred composition usually works best and people complain if there isn't symmetry. Because this is a wide angle view, even being slightly off centre usually has fairly dramatic effects on the perspective (the effect of perspective increases as angle of view increases).

      "comment the Roof and chairs feel a bit too HDRish.©Geni (talk) 17:41, 12 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI did think so too at first, it's the shadows that are weaker than one would expect. But actually if I were to show you an individual frame from the panorama (non-HDR and not processed in any way), it would look very similar. The 'HDR look' of the scene is mainly the way the interior is lit IMO. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 18:05, 12 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nHere's an example of the chairs taken from the brightest frame of the bracket. The only change is reduction of the exposure by 0.70EV to match the brightness of the image. And another example showing the ceiling. This time reduced by 0.90EV to match the brightness of the image. I think both look quite similar to the nominated image. There are differences obviously, but they relate more to the reduction of highlights (such as in the stained glass and reflective surfaces) than a big change to the fundamental tonality of the scene. Anyway, you're welcome to oppose, I just wanted to show you the original files so you could consider if you really think it's 'HDRish'. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 19:35, 12 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]"

      "Comment. The scale needs to be labelled. (I don't buy the argument against doing so, by the way. The percentage of literate people in the world who do not understand \"1 cm\" must be small, and changing it would be pretty trivial anyway for anyone who really wanted to.) 109.153.225.51 (talk) 14:01, 5 July 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nIt is likewise trivial to include the scale in a caption in articles, as necessary. And that has the added bonus of being language-appropriate. — Chris Woodrich (talk) 06:07, 6 July 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nPictures get separated from captions when they are copied and used outside Wikipedia. Also, the absence of the scale annotation just looks like a mistake. It doesn't seem plausible or conceivable that anyone would add a scale and deliberately not label it. 109.152.148.119 (talk) 23:57, 7 July 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nPictures can also be turned pink, purple, or neon green by reusers. To make an album cover, one reuser added grain and deep shadows to an image I took. They can copy the scale, or remove it, or label it themselves. The license doesn't limit them from doing it. If they don't care to copy the size (which is, after all, noted in two separate locations) denoted by the scale, that is their prerogative. That you could not previously conceive of a scale bar that isn't labeled on the image itself doesn't that they don't exist. Here are two other examples: Nature, Journal of Neurophysiology. Yes, labeled bars are more common. No, unlabeled bars are not \"implausible\" or \"inconceivable\".  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 00:34, 8 July 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nPreviously the difficulty of editing the scale label (e.g. to translate) was advanced as an argument against putting it on the image. Now the ease of editing the scale is advanced as an argument against putting the label on the image. 109.153.232.72 (talk) 00:18, 9 July 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nPardon? My issue (\"we agree to disagree. Particularly about the \"smallest\" graphical skills.\") was with your overly sweeping statement that \"anyone with even the smallest graphical skills could replace the text if they really wanted to\". For, say, a three-year-old using Microsoft Paint, your assertion is untenable.\nOr is your issue with the statement that \"text is not as easily replaceable (in JPG) as in SVG\"? It's true. Properly coded SVGs simply require us to open the file in notepad and edit the text. We don't have to worry about formatting or location. JPG requires image editing software, the patience to orient the text properly, and the ability to choose an appropriate font (unless you think a plain straight line goes well with Comic Sans or Ye Olde Font). I said it was more difficult to edit a JPG. I didn't say it was difficult.\nYou have said we \"need\" to label the scale. That \"It doesn't seem plausible or conceivable that anyone would add a scale and deliberately not label it.\". The question of plausibility and conceivability has been answered. Such scales are used elsewhere, in reputable publications. It is certainly not necessary. — Chris Woodrich (talk) 01:42, 9 July 2015 (UTC)[reply]",

It is not easy to make these kinds of images both stylized enough to focus on the important aspects of the topic and to render the three-dimensional shape accurately enough for it to immediately stand out to the reader, and the creator of this image has done an excellent job of exactly that.

It is of high technical quality; the colors represent relationships between categories (related categories have similar colors) and the use of a pastel palette prevents the colors from drawing focus away from the information or associated article. The information is well referenced and the file description is highly informative. The content is based on three major textbooks in the linguistic subfield ofphonology, and while it uses tertiary sources for its content, the file description explains how primary sources may diverge from this standard in particular instances. As an SVG it is scalable to any size (helpful for use outside the encyclopedia, for example, on teaching slides), and it is formatted in such a way that it can be easily translated for multilingual use.",

The photograph isn't especially outstanding technically. For example, most photographs of architectural features require the camera to be absolutely level and perpendiclar to the front face of the building/object.

    "reason": "Chicago first received rapid transit when theSouth Side Elevated Railroadopened on June 6, 1892. Ten stations opened that day, eight of which looked like this 1904 image ofthe station on 18th Street. The railroad subsequently expanded southward, but the station houses on the extension lookedquite differentfrom those on the original portion as depicted here.Unfortunately, the city didn't like these street-level station houses that blocked under-track alley access. When the railroad wished to construct a third center track for express operations in 1907, they were only allowed to do so in exchange for demolishing these station houses and replacing them with mezzanines. Therefore, despite the historic significance of these station houses, pictures of them are rare; none were known to exist in 1995, and even today I know of onlytwootherpictures of these houses, neither of which are of as good quality composition-wise as this.While the rarity of these images should dovetail nicely with this particular image's EV, I am aware that it is rather small. It was originally even smaller, although it was the largest size available on the internet. I actually enlarged it and quadrupled its size (doubling each dimension) in the course of my restoration, but I fear that anything further will start stretching out any artifacts or other blurriness. I've e-mailed the Library of Congress for help in obtaining access any other possible copy of this negative that would yield a larger size if need be.",

While the terms of his study required no payment, he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as Rubens, championed by the school's first president, Joshua Reynolds. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his Discourses that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\"- fromWilliam Blake.But,that said, Blake was a highly unique artist for his time. Reynolds was the mainstream, and as a representative of the mainstream, quite good. Plus, he shows a lot of important people. Probably idealized a bit, but still...John Murray is a very interesting person, one of the leaders of the British side in the leadup to theAmerican Revolution. But more about him anon.",

      "Comment: Beautifully done, but still needs some work. Apart from the above mentioned,\nI think the \"microtubule\" label should be dropped. Since microtubules are the constituent structures of the spindle, labelling both seems redundant and confusing when provided without explanatory text.\nCould the shading be adjusted to make the attached sister chromatids more distinguishable?\nThe crossing-over isn't very clear. Take a look at the bottom tetrad in prophase I. I can't quite tell which arm is attached to which. Also, in metaphase I, the crossed-over arms appear unequal.\nThe aster shouldn't be shown as sun rays; they should have the same appearance as the spindle microtubules (but shorter).\nThe \"Homologous chromosomes\" label in prophase I should probably point to each of the pairs, the way \"Sister chromatids\" does in anaphase I.\nTypo in the anaphase I description: should be \"chromosomes\", not \"chrmosomes\".\nThe description could also be clearer. How about \"separate and move\" instead of just \"move\"?\nProbably not necessary to show the nuclear envelope forming in telophase I only to disintegrate again right away (though the illustration in Campbell's does)?\nDon't think we should say the spindle forms \"around\" the chromosomes (prophase I). Just forms is probably enough, or if necessary, \"in each daughter cell\".\n\"Metaphase II\" probably shouldn't be repeated in the description text.\nMinor issue, but I wonder if the central dark area in the shading of the cells is necessary. It makes the cell look like a target, and it seems to emphasise something that isn't there.\nIt would also be nice to have an image of the late interphase at the beginning, to help the viewer get a picture of the \"normal\" stage before division, but that's just my opinion.",

Would dodging work there? — Crisco 1492 (talk) 11:26, 18 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nHmm, strong shadows was the main (non dental related) issue with the other FP also. But where exactly is the problem? I don't think this image has as much of an issue with shadows, as the only part of her that is really dark is her forehead above the eyes. Obviously there is strong contrast in the late afternoon light and that's what's great about the image IMO. I've got plenty of images of people serving in even, overcast lighting but that also makes the image a bit... boring and undramatic. Anyway, the main problem with dodging the shadows is the introduction of noise - it didn't really work in the other FP and I don't think it will work here.

The previous FP is an infobox style headshot, this one is an action shot. I don't think it's fair to support conditionally on a delist of another image unless there's an obvious improvement on the same subject and it therefore fulfils the same purpose in the article(s). That's not the case here IMO. The way I see it, if you like this image but not the other, support it here and then file a delist nomination separately. Let the community decide what the decision should be, but don't try to manipulate this FPC to get a result that goes beyond this nomination. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 09:34, 19 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nPrecisely. I would not put this image in the infobox, at least not with a headshot available. The infobox is for immediate identification, whereas her playing can be an illustration of her style or the tournament she is participating in. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 10:22, 19 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nBut the portrait only provides \"immediate identification\" of facial characteristics (that would have EV for actors, models, etc), but not what the subject is notable for (tennis player). The texture of her skin, eye colour, etc are much less relevant. Hence I think this is by far the better image for the infobox. I am consistent here with my previous stance on human FPs and would like to see images promoted that provide indication of the subjects profession/notability. I think the promotion of portraits simply because they are high-res is yet another area of FP bias, as if spots on the skin or teeth shape would be the most important information an encyclopaedia can provide. I take however Diliff's other point and withdrew the \"conditional\". --ELEKHHT 23:24, 19 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThere's a reason why identification in official papers etc. is done with portraits (piss poor ones, but portraits nonetheless): the specific combination of eye color, skin tone, facial contours etc. are specific enough to individuals that they allow easy identification. That goes for any individual, be it a tennis player or a Wikipedian. I'm not saying we should feature all portraits we can get, but they do have high value. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 23:31, 20 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI agree, I think identification of an individual is equally important (and featureable) regardless of what they are notable for. That said, if an image can be constructed in such a way that they are easily identifiable and doing what they are notable for, so much the better. In fact, I wouldn't even say that this image of Petra serving is necessarily a good image to identify her, but it does show what she looks like on a tennis court. Currently, the vast majority of our featured portraits are fairly regular bog standard formal portraits. I suppose it doesn't follow that Elekhh personally supported them, but the precedent is there. Also, I think it's missing the point if you think a high res portrait's only benefit is to show skin blemishes and teeth imperfections. We need to think beyond mere thumbnails in articles. Featured images can have a multitude of uses, many requiring high resolution to print at a reasonable DPI without pixelation. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 12:03, 21 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nBut this image is perfectly sufficient for \"identification\", probably more so than her ID photo. --ELEKHHT 02:16, 24 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

Chick Bowen 05:09, 23 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nYour wish has been granted (by Elekhh, it seems), and it is now the lead image. While I don't think the French Open shot is particularly good, the article is large enough to accommodate three photos and it would be a shame to remove a photo of her from earlier in her career just to find a better place for this image. I'm not really convinced that the bottom of the article is the best place for the 'conventional' portrait of her now, but I'll leave the article alone and see if anyone else has an opinion.

      "Why not orient this diagonally? — Chris Woodrich (talk) 01:28, 8 February 2017 (UTC)[reply]\nHi Chris Woodrich, what would be the argument for orienting the clarinet diagonally? Clarinets are usually displayed \"standing\", but we could also show it at an angle. --Gnom (talk) 10:03, 8 February 2017 (UTC)[reply]\nJust my 2 cents, but upright is how the instrument is traditionally played. If it were at an angle it would have to be a picture of the side, which loses EV since you wouldn't see the holes. Just like a trumpet should be shown horizontally. Mattximus (talk) 23:21, 8 February 2017 (UTC)[reply]\nIt doesn't have to be oriented the way it's played if you are just trying to show the instrument. When we have long, narrow objects like this, it is easier for display on Wikipedia if the object is oriented diagonally. Since this object has no background, a simple rotation should do. For example, this bamboo spear was horizontal in the museum where I took the photograph, but since a 3000px * 300px image barely shows up on Wikipedia, I rotated the image diagonally. The same rationale applies for these Pocky sticks (although these were photographed diagonally).",

      "Oppose – John Meints is not mentioned in Tarring and feathering, except in the caption for this photo. Sca (talk) 15:24, 13 October 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nI'm new to FPC so apologies for any misunderstanding. I'm assuming you're alluding to #5 of the featured picture criteria which says that a featured picture \"Adds significant encyclopedic value to an article and helps readers to understand an article.\" I didn't know that the picture also had to be the subject of the article and I thought it would be enough that it shows tarring and feathering (in fact, it's the only photograph in Commons:Category:Tarring and feathering). While researching for the caption, I determined that Meints isn't covered in-depth enough to merit notability. Personally I think the image being used at the top of the article \"helps readers to understand [the] article\" in showing how tarring and feathering actually looks. Opencooper (talk) 15:13, 13 October 2016 (UTC)[reply]",

I really don't see how a photograph of someone who was tarred and feathered doesn't have encyclopedic value on the tarring and feathering article. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what FPC is for so if you could I'd like if you could elaborate on your oppose and how the image doesn't meet the featured picture criteria. Opencooper (talk) 12:35, 14 October 2016 (UTC)[reply]\n@Jobas: Sca now supports the nomination so you should either change your vote or expand on your oppose, thanks.

It appears to depict the Jews gaining prosperity in the United States through \"Perseverance and Industry\" and acknowledging their persecution in the Russian Empire.

      "Neutral - Meh. It's an interesting composition, theoretically, but it's a bit uninspiring in practice here. The upper half is distorted with droplets, and refraction through the wet parts of the lens. The sky is also washed out. The optics of this fisheye lens also works against it here. Notice the figure in the upper left and how distorted s/he is. Moving on to the divers, the picture is better, but, still: underwhelming. There isn't much dynamism in the divers—they're just standing around while being winched up/down. There also isn't anything in the underwater background. It's just a void.

I am no expert for sunrays of any kind, and I give great trust in wikipedia's content, which accurately conforms with the statements in the following article britannica.com: crepuscular-ray. The current entanglement of usage is also prominent by this image being (a) titled \"Sunbeams over Lake Hawea, New Zealand\" in the Sunbeam article and (b) \"Sunlight shining through clouds, giving rise to crepuscular rays\" in the Sunlight article. I really like this image as it nicely combines sunbeams and clouds of mist rising from the sea, and which, by the way, gains yet more at full resolution, and I thus would vote for full support (were I entitled - still 41 wikipedia edits to go ...). But, and this is important, all wikipedia contributions should be as accurate as possible, which may mean rewriting incorrect captions. All taken I pledge for a new scope in the manner of Featured picture for sunbeams instead of (incorrectly attributed) crepuscular rays. -- Franz van Duns (talk) 13:29, 30 August 2019 (UTC)[reply]"

Now let's look at other images in commons:Category:Skagens_Museums_historiske_fotografier\nFile:Anna_Ancher_med_malerkasse_og_lærred_i_Østerby._Ca._1905.jpg is a bad original, made worse by the print. Almost no facial detail. Oh, and check out those retouched chimneys. Speaking of which...\nFile:Anna Ancher og Michael Ancher i indgangen til deres hjem på Markvej 2.jpg is ruined by bad retouching.\nFile:Familien Ancher-Brøndum i Brøndums spisesal på hotellet.jpg was either overexposed as a print, or during scanning. This killed a lot of the facial detail.\nFile:Anna Ancher med kittel, palet og pensler. 1911.jpg is an example of a problematic print, not helped by the scanning. The texture adds lots of noise over what is a pretty good original (though the blurry face isn't doing it any favours.\nFile:Helga Ancher, Havehuset i Skagens Museums have.jpg I presume the original was not plastered over with chromatic abberation. Failure of scanning.\nFile:Marie Krøyer - foto Fred. Riise.jpg Scan too low-res for FPC.\nFile:Anna Ancher i det gamle korntørringsmagasin, også kendt som Krøyers atelier.jpg is a good example of encoding failure. This image is FULL of JPEG artefacting. This was added at the stage when the scan was saved\nFile:Anna, Michael og Helga på heden.jpg  is promising; File:Adjusted Anna, Michael og Helga på heden.jpg  is the last (and most easily fixed) type of failure: there's no reason to cut off Helga's feet.

I think that the previous versions are clearly too bright, but that this took it too far in the opposite direction.

Sven Manguard Wha? 15:39, 16 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nSince the current version comes directly from the Prado Museum, I think other versions may be digitally enhanced (as it happens to other digitized paintings). Perhaps the original painting just faded a bit, lighting conditions may also come into play. Brandmeistertalk 19:30, 16 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Support - The colours are correct.  Because Velazquez was primarily a portrait painter, he didn't have much use for bright yellows. (The Spanish court wore black, grey satin, dark blue velvet.  The king had a red satin suit with silver embroidery, but no-one else would have dared.) So Velazquez has used paint of the pale yellow colour generically known as \"Naples Yellow\" which is a very stable colour that is opaque and doesn't fade. The other colours such as the grey background (which is a mix of blue, brown and white), the contrast of the violet robes against the pinkish madder robes, the tone of the blue of the Virgin's garment are all correct."

But what is most interesting about Cassat's paintings is their modernity, not only in her treatment, but (as Griselda Pollock and Judith Barter point out) in the subject, because whereas Fragonard depicts his subject reading a novel, Cassat has hers reading a newspaper. And then of course there's Edouard Manet's celebrated 1879 Reading where not only do we have a woman reading a newspaper, but reading it in a café and with a glass of beer at hand to boot!

I'm already ready to support, but I do find those odd. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 13:12, 27 June 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nYes, well spotted and a good point. It's  the  museum's image, so that should be safe. But in any case these kind of blue and pink highlights are the Rococo style, copied by Mary Cassatt. Incidentally, I see the NGA zoom facility offers considerably more resolution than what Commons offers. I'll see if I can get that and upload it as a new version. Coat of Many Colours (talk) 13:25, 27 June 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThere are tools available to stitch those tiles together (as I did for File:Raden Saleh.jpg, from the Rijksmuseum), but the downloading takes forever! — Crisco 1492 (talk) 13:51, 27 June 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nNGA download allows up to 3,000 pixels long edge, which is what Commons provides.

      "Comment – I may be in the minority here, but in spite of the partial obstruction by the roofs at the lower right, I actually prefer this photo to the alternative mentioned by Bammesk and endorsed by MER-C above, because this one has significantly more EV. The oblique view gives a much better sense of the building than a simple straight-on picture of the facade, which gives no hint of the shape and size of the structure behind it. Ideally, I'd like to see an image that combines an unobstructed oblique view without the distracting foreground roofs (like this one: File:Melk - Stift (2).JPG) with a greater resolution and sharpness than that photo provides. But given the choice, for the purposes of an encyclopedia, I feel strongly that a slightly flawed oblique view is better than a spectacular frontal view, in spite of the latter's enormous pixel count. Choliamb (talk) 15:52, 22 January 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nThat's a fair point, and definitely a reason to keep this image in the article. I know that, when I was still doing photography, I'd try and get multiple images and angles for exactly that reason. If the rooftops weren't as intrusive, I might even agree with you... but in this case, it feels as though you'd want to get three or four meters up to get the best image.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 02:46, 24 January 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nJust to be clear, I share your reservations about this photo, which is why I offered my comment as a comment rather than a support vote. The problem, as this photo from further away makes clear, is that if you back up enough to get the roofs out of the way, you're likely to end up in the river. What is really needed, as you say, is an extra few meters of height. But the image I linked to in my original comment (File:Melk - Stift (2).JPG, also taken from across the river) shows that it is in fact possible to get a photo that avoids the roofs and still conveys more information than a strictly frontal view. If I were looking for a photograph to use in the classroom, that's the one I would probably choose. And although it seems a little soft when you look at it at full resolution, I would be more likely to support it for FP than the current candidate (or than the frontal view, which is admittedly spectacular on its own terms).

If the caption is misleading, that could be POV, and the article, as I said, talks about fires in a few isolated cases, but not enough to really explain the image. It's not very well documented beyond \"This is a satellite view from this day\" and \"You can see fires in it\"; I think it reasonable to expect more, like linking at least most of the fires to incidents.

Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 8.8% of all FPs. 11:35, 1 March 2024 (UTC)[reply]\nHi, I processed this image and while I am grateful for the nomination and see no POV problems I support the decision to not make this a featured picture.\nThe description on the image is limited to what basically says \"fires can be seen\" on purpose because from a single satellite image, without further local context, it is almost impossible to determine the cause of a fire. Could have been a mortar shell, a rocket, lightning, electrical failure, or someone with a lighter setting a fire. While this picture certainly has some historical value, it should go along with a well researched news article in proper context. And though you could draw conclusions from the sudden appearance of so many fires at once, especially compared to the average day, this would still leave room for a lot of interpretation.\nAdditionally the image being a composite of natural colors and infrared, it should be noted that the \"fires\" that can be seen here are just areas of high IR emissions, which is a well-established technique to detect fires from space. However, this is not what the region would look like from space, as most, if not all of these fires were too small to be seen clearly (or at all) in natural colors from space. That is another thing that I believe would have to be communicated to the average viewer and makes using an image like this one even more cumbersome.

Is this a stitched panorama, or did you just crop the top and bottom of a regular 3:2 aspect ratio image? I noticed that the horizontal resolution of the image is 8972 pixels, but the Nikon D7100 has a resolution of only 6000x4000 pixels. So if it isn't stitched, you have obviously upsampled the image to get 8972 pixels wide. It certainly appears upsampled based on the very poor sharpness, but as Crisco mentioned, even at 50% size, the image quality issue is apparent. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 12:48, 5 December 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nGood Eye, and it looks like you are correct.

Bammesk (talk) 00:51, 20 August 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nFor some people, it's simply impossible. You can at least try by displaying the pair in a smaller size (say, 100 mm or so), then concentrate your focus on your own nose tip, and slowly let your eye muscles relax. At some point the images (may hopefully) coalesce, and you see the 3-D image. This one is really good, BTW. --Janke | Talk 07:06, 20 August 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nAs Janke correctly states, cross-eyed viewing is impossible for some people (including my wife and others I have tested in this request, check Stereoscopy#Visual_requirements), but it is otherwise very handy for unaided viewing straight from the screen, as no viewing apparatus is required. Works astoundingly well (at least for me) even if the stereo pair is displayed at full screen size, thus providing a level of detail not possible with standard stereo viewers due to their limited image size. See article Stereoscopy#Freeviewing, which explains the two possible arrangements for stereo viewing.  For all others I have supplied a version arrranged for parallel viewing (click on the above image and scroll to \"Other versions\"), which can be viewed under a stereoscope / stereoscopic viewer after having been resized to a range between 60x60 mm and 100x100 mm each image. And, for any other purpose, e.g. stereo viewing of individual sections of a stereo image, I have also supplied the two single images which compose the stereo pairs. Just enlarge these, each within its own individual window, say to 50%, then shift both images until the detail you are interested in is centered in each window. Arrange the two windows (R-L or L-R) as required for your chosen viewing method and now enjoy an abundancy of details within this section in full stereo that even a full screen display simply cannot render. This is only possible if the images, as here, are provided with a relatively high resolution. Caveat: I know that this is, of course, not encyclopaedic information, but it may be of value for others who have difficulties viewing stereo images or for those who intend to enhance their knowledge about methods of viewing images. I have been taking stereo images for quite a number of years and would designate myself as an experienced photography amateur, now retired, with a background of astrophysics. Would it help if I extended the section Freeviewing by a concise version of \"What must I do? I simply can't see any stereo effect.\" or similar. Who would I as a newbie have to contact ahead before adding any unwelcome text and thus possibly causing an uproar amongst a multitude of seasoned editors?

It isn't perfect, no picture truely is, but the following technical considerations do give support to my entry: this image is an example of a photographic technique rarely practiced nowadays, it reproduces all colours without undue exaggeration, and it displays a tremendous amount of detail from one edge to the other, even if fully viewed at a resolution only few contemporary camera sensors can provide.

Plane length 232ft, speed 560miles/hour, so the plane moves 0.9% of its body length in 1/400 seconds (which is 11 pixels in our image). There is no way the image can be this sharp if the plane moved 11 pixels during exposure. So the shutter speed metadata is wrong. A realistic exposure would be 1/4000 seconds or faster (which the Canon 400D barely makes). On the other hand, the image has EV, is technically good, is difficult to shoot and to replicate, and per Wolftick more sky [2] doesn't help a lot (although I think it helps some).

Adam Cuerden (talk) 22:02, 1 January 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nMay I ask how you can tell that it's cropped enough to be unusable? The evidence of a dark line signifying the edge of the picture along at least half of each virtical edge would indicate to me that it isn't cropped, at least not enough to say the map would be impossible that it could be used in same way as the original map... To me, it's missing maybe a millimetre or two off half the edges - I certainly wouldn't oppose for that reason...

      "Oppose - Looks over-processed, i.e. HDR effects. Kaldari (talk) 16:45, 29 October 2019 (UTC)[reply]\n\"This photo is a single shot, no HDR, no [retouches], no cut and paste\", according to the photographer. --- Coffeeandcrumbs 17:19, 29 October 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nFrom the discussion you linked to, it sounds like the over-processed appearance is due to lightening the shadows while darkening the sky (which is superficially similar to the effect you would get with HRD). According to the featured image criteria \"Typical acceptable manipulation includes cropping, perspective correction, sharpening/blurring, and colour/exposure correction. More extensive manipulation should be clearly described in the image text.\" Selective lightening and darkening (especially to the point where it looks unnatural) seems like it would qualify as \"more extensive manipulation\". The unmanipulated original image would be more appropriate for Wikipedia (if the photographer was willing to provide it). Kaldari (talk) 20:57, 30 October 2019 (UTC)[reply]\n@Kaldari: What exactly do you mean by \"unmanipulated original\"? The raw file? Afaik there is no way to upload raws to commons. And to get a view from the RAW-data one needs some kind of development anyway. And all I did to develop this photo was an overall enhancement of the gradation. So basicly the same thing almost every a bit more experience photographer does in Lightroom with almost anny image - not even talking about smartphones and consumer cameras, that have this kind of image processinge already built in.Anyhow: The atmosphere of this image comes quite close to what a saw there with my own eyes that day (Here is a view from the opposite direction). And the fact that cameras nowadays are able to handle a dynamic range that comes closer to the one of out eyes, imo makes a shot more realistic than less. // Martin Kraft (talk) 16:00, 1 November 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI'm sure you know what I mean by \"unmanipulated original\". I agree that enhancing photographs is commonplace and generally desirable. Wikipedia, however, prefers purely documentary photographs over beautiful photographs (unlike Commons). My issue with the photo is that the scenery appears brightly lit, as if on a sunny cloudless day, while the sky appears full of heavy clouds (that somehow don't have any shadows). To my eye, it looks unreal. The composition is superb, however, and I would gladly support featuring a less manipulated version. I hope that sounds reasonable. Kaldari (talk) 16:34, 1 November 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nNo sorry, I really do not know, what you mean by \"unmanipulated original\". Because something like \"the original\" does not exist in digital photography, since every step that goes beyond the raw elektronic information coming from the chip already is a manipulation of this data. And that is not limeted to the things a photograprapher can do in post processing but also includes the things the camera itself is doing to generate a preview version from the very same data. As you might know a professional cameras support a lot of parameters, that define how this preview is developed from the raw. Consumer cameras also include this development process, usually one can only use presets. The idea that there is such a thing as a digital original is therefore an illusion.This aside, I doupt that the image would be any better from an encyclopedic point of view, if the dynamic range of the image would be so limited, that the sky burns out to white while the frame is solid black. Please do not confuse the limited dynamic range we are used to by older cameras, with what was really visible there to the clear eye. Standing on the window, I did not neither see black underexposed areas nor a burned out sky, but the clouds as well as the paint on the frame.One last comment about the weather: There are a lot of weather conditions between gloomy cloudy and crystal clear sky. And about the best weather condition ist the one yout see here: A lot of moving clouds of different opacity, that deliver as sunny ligthing without hard shadows.Of course yout are free to stick to you're judgement, but please note, that there is no absolute right or wrong when it comes to the color grading of a photograph.  // Martin Kraft (talk) 17:17, 1 November 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI didn't say unprocessed original, I said unmanipulated original (I'm familiar with using RAW files). And I generally have no problem with digital manipulation, as long as it still looks realistic. I realize that this is a subjective judgement and prone to error, but that's still my judgement. It also looks like someone in the Commons discussion had the same concerns, although I don't now why anyone on Commons would care. Kaldari (talk) 18:02, 1 November 2019 (UTC)[reply]",

      "I'm completely neutral, honestly. It's obviously not the best waterfall picture ever taken: the clunky angle, unsightly metal guardrail,  concrete ledge lend it a sort of 'snapshot' quality that many casual readers are sure to find subpar for an FP. The technical quality of the photo leaves much to be desired, also; it's quite noisy, soft (a bit of motion blur?), likely tilted clockwise, and overexposed on parts of the falls themselves. The light inside the gorge isn't bad, however. All that said, there aren't many pictures of this waterfall online, and even fewer 'good' ones, likely attributable to the barricades and hordes of sightseers evident from my link ↑. I doubt you would be able to get a tripod set up and create a fine art-grade photo of this particular spot, so I think the nominated picture might be about as close as we're going to get to an FP-level shot of this waterfall. Normally I would be more willing to support a less-than-stellar photo of a difficult spot, but I'm not convinced that it's impossible to take an incrementally better picture here.

Adam Cuerden (talk) 18:13, 16 September 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nMaking the shelf upright exactly vertical loses very little, and nothing of any consequence that I can see.

The arm detail matches neither the patch nor any JPEG version; Some shapes have changed - for example, the dark triangle-like shapes moving towards the tentacle from the eye are three in number on the patch, and two on the vector, etc. Vectors are great when there isn't an official realization - coats of arms, etc - but aren't for everything. That said, if we could get a high-res JPEG to vectorise - a FOIA request should get that, if nothing else - I think this could all be fixed, but given the choice between a vector from a low-resolution JPEG, or a patch, I'll take the patch.

      "If this nom passes, we should delist This FP. Bammesk (talk) 16:57, 13 February 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nShould we? I think sometimes iconic photos can be ruined by changing them for accuracy. In this case, it was colour corrected fifty years later based on a different photograph in different lighting. I'm not entirely sure of the methodolog, given we have to ask how much any photo can exactly reflect the human eye. There's no one right answer as to exposure. Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 7.6% of all FPs 17:14, 13 February 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nNonetheless, digital white-balancing is considerably more accurate nowadays than the chemical processing from the 1970s. NASA themselves have released various chromatically-altered versions through out the years (https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/the-blue-marble-the-view-from-apollo-17) and yet we stick by the purple version. Aaron1a12 (talk) 17:38, 13 February 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nAaron1a12, the flickr source here gives a ~ 2500 x 2500 pixel image after cropping, not 3000x3000 pixels? Bammesk (talk) 22:02, 13 February 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nThe source is primarily from a JSC/ASU scan, not flickr. It's actually higher-res than the flickr source.

      "Comment – FWIW the film frames are at this link. The nominated frame/capture AS17-148-22727 is here. Two frames earlier is the AS17-148-22725 here and it's different. The end frame of the '148' magazine (presumably the color calibration) is here. For comparison, we have this. Bammesk (talk) 20:07, 13 February 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nThe large resolution .PNGs are already color-processed by ASU and are, in fact, copyrighted by the university. The copyright-free 1.2 GB raw file is where you want to start if you want to color-calibrate it yourself. The original pic is quite dark and how you interpret the gamma will greatly affect the look when correcting exposure.  BTW: nice photo from the ISS Cupola you got there! The blues in the ocean look remarkably similar to the blues in this photo. Aaron1a12 (talk) 00:59, 14 February 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nNom image has better colors than this older version, but it looks overexposed (by about half a stop i.e. 0.5EV) (just the midtones, not the highlights). I support if it's adjusted. About the comparison-image, I think it's background is overexposed too (overexposure of bright spots is common in high dynamic range photos). Bammesk (talk) 03:19, 15 February 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nI've lowered the EV slightly now (your browser cache might take time to update). Histogram's looking good.

(I'm imagining it's meant to represent the powder being ignited, but nothing else about the picture suggests the cannon is in the process of being fired - there's no representation of powder or fire in the vent or vent field, or of a match being applied, or of any movement to the wadding or ball.)

It's a really interesting scene and compositionally it's fine, but there is a lot of chromatic aberration on the sides, the stained glass is washed out and has blown highlights and the shadows are a little dark and muddy. I'm quite biased towards these sort of photos as I've been doing a lot of similar photography recently. I put quite a lot of work into mosaic-stitched, HDR tone mapped post processing to get my images looking crisp and clean, and I just don't think this image matches those standards. I'm not saying every image needs a similar level of complexity for me to support it, but some scenes such as this one, with stained glass, really cry out for that kind of processing.

Think some of the marks look like scuffs, so I left those in.Oh, I should probably point out the curves adjustment. I'm rather proud of that: Was able to recover a fair bit of detail in the bright whites, which is always nice. I'd imagine this was shot a bit on the over-exposed side as, well, frankly, film stock was calibrated for white people - but at least the photographer making the effort to work around them means that she is well-photgraphed.Oh, and for the record, this is the poster:https://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/LEM/- the apparent smear on the left of the moon is definitely a real lunar feature.",

It's a question that after all has been debated with respect to nude images of young people on Wikipedia rather a lot in the past. In the end Mr. Wales himself had to step in and make a common sense ruling about the matter and delete the images. The common sense question about this image you should ask yourself is whether the image would gratify a paedophile and the answer is of of course yes it would. We do all know that now. Go on to any beach in the UK and start taking pictures of children and you run the risk of being arrested. Take an unsolicited picture of a nude young girl skinny dipping as you see depicted here and you certainly will be, if not lynched first. Now that of course doesn't mean images of this painting should be deleted from their articles. But it does mean that we should be sensitive in the matter of featuring it. It's not for nothing that this painting is not available for viewing at the Met. Similarly the Tate has removed its  Ovendens from public display.

      "Support  Let me be clear: as a gay man, perhaps I am uniquely unqualified to assess the image's sexually erotic or pornographic content.  As an aesthete, however, I look at this painting and I say, \"Why, it looks lovely.\"  I can see that the young girl has the earliest suggestions of breasts, but their presentation here speaks only of that, and while I do consider breasts generally to be something which is often construed sexually, I don't feel like I would accuse anyone in whose collection I found such a painting of likely having acquired it for sexual purposes or interests— it's, well, it's just not \"dirty enough\" (by which I mean to say, \"not dirty\").  It strikes me as nothing more than a beautiful presentation of feminine youth.  I see nothing vulgar here.  Now, of course, that does not mean that another equally reasonable person cannot see something vulgar or cannot construe this as an inappropriate representation of naked youth, and does not mean that a genuine paedophile might not decide that the image is arousing somehow and go on to do bad things as a result.  But I find the proposition of that to be far more of a stretch.  Maybe I should also mention that again, as a gay man who is honestly very tired of seeing Jennifer Lopez' \"booty\" and was blessed never to have witnessed Miley Cyrus \"twerking,\" nothing in this painting tires me, which perhaps suggests its value as art is greater than its value as porn of any kind, whether or not the subject is age-appropriate (\"age-appropriate,\" a factor which becomes irrelevant if the picture is, in fact, evocative of art and not of more base emotions, and I am comfortable saying it is the former and simultaneously is not the latter).  I feel I know this because of the queasy feeling I do NOT get when I study it.  My barometer doesn't shift.  It just seems nice, pretty.  I like the color tones.  I like the splashes of light.  To the extent that the image is of high quality and is of great accuracy (both of which seem to be true, yes?), then it meets the criteria of our other featured pictures.  How old the model is has no bearing in a non-sexual image.  And lastly, as the brother of a woman who spent a year as a federal prosecutor of child pornographers in the Central District of Southern California and who agonized over the hours of pornographic videotape she was required as part of her job to watch in order to be able to effectively prosecute the offenders (an area of assignment that she requested out of because it made her so ill), sometimes, I think, a cigar is maybe just a cigar.

      "Comment Hafspajen, sorry, but you're missing the point. Neither I nor, I assume, Coat of Many Colours is objecting to nudity as such. I myself had a clothing-optional early childhood, as an older woman I continue to be shockingly immodest by North American standards (shocked a doctor - again - just days ago), I can't think of much that's more ridiculous than having to be clothed to swim or not being able to go naked when it's too hot for clothes, and I have been frequenting the great galleries of Europe for fifty years totally unfazed by 99.9% of the nudes. The problem is not the FACT of nudity, but in this instance the exploitative NATURE of the depiction of the nakedness of an underage girl. Awien (talk) 13:53, 21 September 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Comment Having now helped Crisco out by translating a French critic for him, and as a result looking at other reproductions, it now seems to me that the colour of this reproduction is heavily skewed towards gold. The palette was described as a symphony in grey (blue-grey, green-grey, violet-grey), whereas there's no grey at all in this reproduction. It probably doesn't adequately represent the painting.

      "Prof. Brauer kindly replied to my emailed request for the article Coat originally cited for the 11–13 y.o. estimate (which I will read and parse either tomorrow or the day after). This is pertinent to the current discussion because her article includes a detail and reproduction of the painting, with a significant yellow tinge. The only difference is that it is brighter and that what appears to be damage to the canvas is rather prominent. She does not explicitly state where the image came from, though, whether it is a photograph she took or an adjustment of the MET's scan. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 16:46, 22 September 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "The image used by Fae Brauer shows damage typical of a dirty and scratched colour slide. Note the rectangular black object lower middle and the two fine lines at an angle to each other. Severe colour fringing at the top may be caused by the slide surface losing contact with a glass surface (mounting or scanner plate). The general dirt actually looks more like what would occur on a paper-based reproduction- could also be dirt on the original canvas- however the reduction in tonal separation in the painting's background suggests that there's some kind of generational gap between Brauer's image and the painting- as if someone had photographed an old and worn postcard on slide film and then left the slide unprotected in an office drawer.

      "Neutral. I'm not sure. Compositionally it's nice enough, and the lighting (for a non-studio shot) is pretty good, but his skin tone looks very red to me. And it's a little blurred at 100%. Just not quite sure it's up there for FP. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 12:56, 29 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI'll see what I can do. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 15:03, 29 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI've reduced the tint by four (less red color) and used less drastic denoising (as well as a wee bit of downsizing). Diliff, I hope this is better. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 15:43, 29 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nStill not sure it's much better. Needs a bit more (on my screen, at least). I had a go myself prior to commenting but couldn't reduce the redness without unduly affecting the image generally (but that was a crude attempt with the colour balance in Photoshop). You use Lightroom, right? And I assume it was taken in RAW? What I suggest is playing with an adjustment brush over just his skin. I'm not sure exactly what adjustments would be required but possibly a slight reduction in saturation and some tint/temp adjustments? I would have a go but it's always best to do it with the RAW files. Still, not a lot can be done about the slight blur which is the other half of the issue. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 16:26, 29 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nNot too sure I see the blur, except maybe the nose (though that may be slightly OOF). I mean, the line between his jaw and the background looks perfectly crisp to me. Anyhow, I've tried to bring down the redness of his skin a bit.. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 16:46, 29 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI think you've found a good skin tone now, certainly improved on the original. No, the focus isn't an issue (if anything, the nose is the sharpest part of the image) the blur is somewhat universal across the image. It's only slight and I'm being a little picky, but it appears to be camera shake to me. Just looking at the settings, you used 1/40th of a second and 100mm (160mm effective due to the crop sensor). That is usually too slow for handheld (rule of thumb is not to let the shutter speed drop below the effective focal length), although can be rescued with image stabilisation in some instances. I suspect that the IS has assisted with stability but not been 100% effective, leaving a slight blur. As I said, it's minor but noticeable to me. Compare with one of my portraits from the EU parliament earlier in the year. I was using a lens that would be technically less sharp than your lens, but I find the image itself a bit sharper (ignoring the resolution difference). I suspect the only difference is that mine was taken with a studio flash setup. That doesn't in itself make the image sharper, but it does freeze the subject better, so any camera or subject motion is eliminated. Anyway, in any case, I'm not suggesting you can only take FP portraits in a studio setting. I'm going to weak support because I think it's still a quality portrait, but not perfect. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 18:04, 29 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nFair enough. I could probably have gone to ISO 320 or 500 without the noise being too much, and 1/80 or so would have probably been enough to eliminate the last vestiges of camera shake. Still technically breaking the rule of thumb, but then 1/80 worked pretty well for an image of the chairman (though admittedly that one had much shallower DOF). — Crisco 1492 (talk) 23:41, 29 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nPerhaps even just taking a few more photos (not sure if you took many or just one) would have been enough. Usually when my shutter speed is too slow to handhold, I take around 10 photos in succession (with finger held down on the shutter release that is, not pressing the button individually for each photo, which would introduce shake). I find that there's often a very large difference in sharpness between them even though my hands felt steady, and usually a couple of them will be objectively sharp. Anyway, plenty of ideas for next time. I know you don't generally have time to think about things or review your images when someone is standing there waiting for you, so more images is always better than less. Might not be the most cerebral way to take photos, but it's safer. Photojournalists/sports photographers don't shoot thousands of images of the same thing for nothing. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 10:06, 30 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThanks for the feedback. I'll keep it in mind. (BTW, if you're interested in volcanic craters I've got some interesting ones of Kawah Putih on my talk page.

      "Question The wall on the right is strange. I guess it is like this in all prints that you've found. Charlesjsharp (talk) 22:20, 20 July 2024 (UTC)[reply]\n@Charlesjsharp: That's the edge of a, like, column or pillar? It's definitely a real object. You can see it better in a different image (sadly unavailable at a decent size) from the photographic session - I'm going to call that the \"NYPL\" image, for convenience.  We could crop it: some of the publication uses crop or edit it out - [12] for example, which is the thumbnail for [13] is a half-tone print that crops rather harshly on the right. Likewise, there's a very harsh crop at [14], [15] - which I'd guess are photogravures or something else that degrades the image, because they're definitely worse quality than the photographic print I restored. I think they're the same image, but given I can barely tell the NYPL is different (look at the thumb and lack of wool on the table), I don't want to discount there being a third image that they were based on.   Other copies like the Emily Dickenson Museum one appear to be a copy of the half-tone print from the LOC.\nThere may (have been?) other images in that session. I think it's a drawing, but [16] looks a lot like the images from this session, but with a hand pose that blocks her face. It's definitely a drawing in File:Helen Hunt Jackson (The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review, 1893).png and [17]. If that is based on a photo - and I can't see why you'd move the hand to block view of the face - the hand position likely blocks it from consideration, quirky though it may be. Meanwhile [18] - while composited - may indicate the existence of a standing photo of her. Possibly the same as this, but I'm starting to lose track of all these images.[19] has some thumbnails, including a few of a very young Jackson. All very small.\nWe're nearing the end. Abandoning Conly to see what's out there, we can immediately abandon the goblin-faced terrible artwork in \"A Short History of England's and America's Literature\".  There's another mediocre sketch on the Library of  Congress.\nFinally, there's this from the Huntington, probably the best of the non-Conly photos that's available at a decent size.  [20] is similar.  This book has a lovely image of her, but I don't know where they got it from.\nHope this helps! Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 8.9% of all FPs. 00:08, 21 July 2024 (UTC)[reply]\nJust to note, [21] does have the book cover image; probably cropped. Tineye indicates it was on JSTOR at some point? Honestly, if somone has the book, it'd probably be easier to check the photograph credit. Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 8.9% of all FPs. 01:51, 21 July 2024 (UTC)[reply]",

Apart from cropping the frame and cleaning up the most obvious blemishes, I didn't tinker with it much, partly because I don't have a lot of spare time for Wikipedia-related tasks, and partly because it was already in relatively good shape for a historical photo. But I have no ownership issues and it's fine with me if others want to put more work into it.

(talk) 16:04, 2 June 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nIt's a good photo, but I'd like to see it in her article. I'm not saying you can't promote multiple images for multiple uses, but that's usually from sense of time, e.g. a young Darwin, or W.S. Gilbert nearer the age he wrote a play; What makes her more Australian in this photo than any of the other ones from her Diamond Jubilee? Is there a wallaby cropped just out of frame? Does the crown have corks dangling from it that were photoshopped out?\nI'm a bit sarcastic there, but ye see the point.

      "Oppose until copyright issues are cleared up. First, what is the copyright status of this image in the US? It was likely renewed owing to the URAA (1958 + 51 = 2009, well after the extension date)? Second, is there any indication that this was first published in Israel? The source has jack regarding that. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 09:45, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nHuh, a posed picture for the Israeli Press Office, and you need evidence that it was published in Israel? --ELEKHHT 10:03, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWhere does it say on the image page that this was taken for the press office, rather than by Pridan on his own? Even if this was first published in Israel, the URAA concerns are enough for me to oppose. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 10:07, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nAt that time Pridan worked for the Israeli Government Press Office, so this falls under Commons Category:PD Israel & British Mandate. As for URAA, I believe this qualifies as PD-1996. Brandmeistertalk 11:18, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nHow would it qualify as PD-1996, at all? If this is a government-owned work, then the 2008 copyright extensions applied to this image (making it copyrighted in Israel as well). I'm nominating for deletion. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 12:45, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nSee meta:Israeli new copyright law: \"the previous status-quo will continue to apply to state-owned photographs (the equivalent of Crown copyright), i.e. any photograph whose copyrights are owned by the state will be subject to the 50 year period arrangement also under the new law.\". Since the file's metadata confirms this is a work of the Israeli Government Press Office, per Israeli copyright law: \"copyright in a work in which the State is the first owner of the copyright in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5 shall last for a period of 50 years from the date of its making\". Brandmeistertalk 15:53, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI'd say, absent evidence to the contrary, that when a government says the works it owns are out of copyright, we can take that as sufficient. Adam Cuerden (talk) 01:13, 27 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nIn that state. But AFAIK, Israel does not consider the PD status of its works to apply worldwide when works become PD owing to age (compare the UK's Crown Copyright, which does apply worldwide), which means the URAA is still a consideration — Crisco 1492 (talk) 01:49, 27 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nHe actually worked there for much longer then that. Additionally we can probably upload that photo as well as I am pretty sure we have approval from the Israeli GPO via OTRS (ticket #2012112010011362) --CyberXRef☎ 00:59, 27 March 2014 (UTC)[reply]"

      "Oppose — Not to minimize the historical importance of the Armenian Genocide — but I suspect few readers/viewers will take interest in a map showing the localities of an atrocity that took place more than a century ago. Sca (talk) 16:53, 22 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThis is ridiculous. The Armenian Genocide remains a controversial, salient and interesting topic. Even if it weren't, the fact that there is an article discussing the events and locations on the map demonstrates that it has EV. It doesn't matter if you (or readers) find it difficult to take an interest.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.222.132.240 (talk) 22:07, 22 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWhether you are interested in the topic or not is irrelevant to the FP criteria. Nick-D (talk) 22:44, 22 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nComment - There's plenty of FP maps of cities and towns 200+ years old, why should this be an exception? Should we delist an FP of the Yosemite National Park in 1871 under the assumption that no one cares about how parks looked like 140+ years ago? Also, this massacre happened six years prior to the start of the Armenian Genocide and is not directly related to that event. However, it did bear fruit to a culture of massacres that culminated into a genocidal campaign. Étienne Dolet (talk) 18:15, 22 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Oppose No source provided for the information presented on the map, and it's not a very good quality map at present: the stubs of railway tracks (not connected to the train station!) on the western half of the map seem unlikely to be accurate, the roads into town suddenly end when they hit the built-up area (with what I presume are the roads within the town being depicted as gaps of pretty much the same width between built-up areas), no explanation is provided for the localities marked with orange squares, and the map doesn't have a scale. Also, what's the story with the colour-coding of text: I can understand different colours being used to distinguish the Christian and Muslim sites, but why are the gardens and fields marked in Muslim green? I have to say that I'm getting pretty sick of the steady stream of low-quality FPC nominations on Armenian-related images: is there a campaign going on here or something? If so, please pay more attention to quality control. Nick-D (talk) 22:34, 22 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

Étienne Dolet (talk) 21:29, 23 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nSo just to be clear, one crescent means a mosque but 5 crescents means a cemetery? That is a very strange system and needs to be fixed. Mattximus (talk) 21:32, 25 February 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI'm not the maker of the map but I presume that they are supposed to signify tombstones.

The focus is slightly off (it appears sharp only on one small part of the middle of the wing), and depth of field is more limited than (IMO) it needs to be, which further exacerbates the issue. It was taken at f/6.3 and I think f/8 or f/11 would have been more appropriate, especially given lighting conditions. It was only taken at ISO 200. It could have been bumped as high as ISO 800 without becoming too noisy, which would have allowed a much more suitable aperture for getting as much of the butterfly in focus as possible.

This should be explained in the nomination so that it can be taken into consideration.\" On these grounds, since this is the largest national protest in the U.S. since the Vietnam War, a case could be made for an exception on historically relevant grounds.

The heavy blur of the foreground bokeh is distracting. Such blur is common in backgrounds (expected), but not usually seen in foregrounds.

Gnangarra 07:42, 15 June 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nI know perfectly well how scans are usually done. The problem is with the Wiki software itself. JPGs get extra sharpening when they are downsampled for articles/commons, whereas (last I checked) PNG and TIF do not (see Commons:File types). The file size also affects, to the best of my knowledge, the bandwidth necessary to download a page. I may be mistaken on this; if Adam or someone else who is more up to date than me could confirm, that would be great. — Chris Woodrich (talk) 08:31, 15 June 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nthe image is clear here, on the article page and one the commons page, I do note that the file has been adjusted on commons 3 times since upload to fix a tif issue given that if it was an issue someone would have made a jpg image, but we should still be presenting the best image format as the FP not a lossy format converted from it..... Gnangarra 09:26, 15 June 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nI think it's a very bad idea to assume that someone would fix such an issue; not everyone thinks of everything. As for TIFF, the page I linked above states explicitly \"[TIFF is] an archival format, and should never be used for images intended to be displayed.\" Help:Files#Uploading_files also lists it as supported, but doesn't include it in a list of recommended types.I'm not saying that we shouldn't have a TIFF copy; far from it. I'm just saying that, for article use, we should have JPG; this is supported by documentation on Commons and the English Wikipedia. Sadly, as such I must oppose for now. The technical quality is acceptable for me, but the format is an issue, particularly for users opening articles on low bandwidths (From Commons: \"thumbnails are generated in the same format as the original image and are always in 24-bit color ... This means that scaling PNG images produces fairly large files even if the original image contained a palette, or was in grayscale format\"; this presumably applies to TIFF as well) — Chris Woodrich (talk) 15:02, 15 June 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n@Crisco 1492: Gnangarra 06:12, 18 June 2015 (UTC)[reply]",

The tilt isn't that concerning to me (I think there's a slight perspective tilt, with buildings leaning inwards due to tilting the camera upwards slightly), but bigger problems for me are that the exposure just isn't very good (would have been better to take it earlier in the evening when there was some residual glow in the sky to fill the shadows with more detail, and to avoid overexposure of the building lighting), and there's an overall softness of the image that I've also noticed in WPPilot's aerial images.

For the most part my aerial photos are shot now on Leica or Nikon. On Nikon I use prime lenses and I have a lot of them. ECIF on the photo I posted shows it was a wide angle lens (15mm). When doing the aerial photos I am also flying the plane that creates a lot of harmonic vibration, so I could see it resulting in a little \"softness\" as you referred to it, but that night shot was set on a tripod, with a brand new Nikon D 7100 in aperture priority mode with a remote shutter release. My Lens selections proved me with no more the F1.8 so I have plenty of glass. --WPPilot 15:04, 11 February 2014 (UTC)(talk)\nYou're right that there doesn't seem to be any reasonable explanation for the softness in this image, and yet, there it is.

      "Weak support — I like the image. The focus is obviously the girl in the middle. She is reasonably sharp and the straight into-the-camera look while she grasps and partly hides herself behind the boy next to her really makes a beautiful photo that urges me to read an article about these kids. The problem is, the EV is thin and spread widely. Both the Afghanistan and the Demography of Afghanistan articles use the image in a mere table as an example of Pashtun people. The latter also uses a crop of the picture in this image that is also used in a few other articles like Pashtunistan and Pashtun_diaspora. Since these kids cannot really be identified as Pashtun people by the reader (no traditional dress or similar characteristics) their EV lies in their story, i.e. how they got to Camp Clark where this photo was taken. Without an article on Camp Clark or on the US-operation that got these kids there the EV is limited. --Ebertakis (talk) 23:23, 30 January 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

Sixty-six different main designs (not including varieties) were issued (69 were created, but 3 were not put into circulation). Portraits byAlbrecht Dürer,Hans Holbein the Younger,Hans Memling,Barthel Beham, andBarthel Bruyn the Elder(among others) are used on some of the papiermark notes.Severe war time and post-World War Iinflation spiraled intohyperinflationnecessitating larger and larger denominations of banknotes. The four-year Weimar Republic papiermark issue spans 35 denominations ranging from 10 mark to 100 trillion mark. In October 1923 Germany suffered the fourth highest inflation rate in modern history (29,500% for the month, approximately 21% interest daily).For the sake of accuracy, it is important to note that one denomination is missing from the current set. The 50 trillion (billionen) mark note is arguably the rarest in the denomination set. Several museum-housed numismatic collections contain the 100 trillion (billionen) mark note while lacking an example of the 50 billionen (e.g.,National Numismatic Collection,Münzkabinettof theStaatliche Museen zu Berlin). Attempts made over the past six months to obtain a high quality/high resolution image of the note from the numismatic community (i.e., world paper money dealers and auction houses) have been fruitless.An exampledoes exist on commons, but it is a low quality image that does not fit with the image size, quality, and detail of the remaining notes in the set. The search will continue until a suitable example is found.Thanks in advance to reviewers of this longer than usual set nomination.",

      "Hi Armbrust, looking at the above I see 5 users who favor \"replace\", 4 users in bold letters and 1 user (the nominator) in their answer \"Fine with me\" to Adam's question: \"Are the two of you alright with Replace?\". So I see consensus to replace. I don't understand the no promote? Bammesk (talk) 01:54, 2 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nSee \"How to comment for Candidate Images\" in the lead of WP:FPC. \"Replace\" isn't an option. Armbrust The Homunculus 02:44, 2 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nOk. \"Replace\" implied \"delist\" (replacement can only happen after a delist), so the intent of the participants was \"delist and replace\", but the participants didn't express their intent in the proper format. I suggest moving the nom to the section: \"Older nominations requiring additional input from users\" and then pinging the participants asking them to express their intent in the proper format. Not promoting, at this point, effectively ignores the intent of the participants. Bammesk (talk) 03:23, 2 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nBut replace requires the nominated picture should be featured, no? I may renominate these as D&R when participation next picks up. MER-C 07:22, 2 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nBammesk The problem is that in a \"candidate nomination\" delist & replace isn't a valid option either. You either support or oppose the image being promoted (including their weak variants).MER-C The D&R process isn't, IMO, really there to replace images with a completely different one. This was discussed in December 2013, but nothing came of it. Armbrust The Homunculus 16:08, 2 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI think it's reasonably clear that the voting participants were of the view that the image should be promoted. I think whether the other image should be delisted ought to be separate issue and a corresponding delist nomination. Similar story with the oystercatcher image. JJ Harrison (talk) 09:26, 4 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI've gone ahead and renominated both images. If the result is promote, then I'll replace the other usages and nominate the older images for delisting. MER-C 03:31, 5 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]"

In his oppose, Chris Woodrich asks \"What color? What materials?\" To which I would respond that you can certainly tell by the structure in this image that the pier would have to be made out of metal, as wood that thin would not be able to support itself. As far as color, yes that is difficult to determine on this image, but I think the aesthetic quality of this image outweighs the negative of the pier not being seen in true color. And technically, color is an illusion created by your brain anyway. Rreagan007 (talk) 18:05, 12 August 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n\"technically, color is an illusion created by your brain anyway.\" - The same argument could be made for running all B&W pictures, or a photograph of a valley with a red sky and purple earth. The color and details visible in a front-lit image allows us to narrow down the material to more than just \"metal\"; we can (hopefully) tell the difference between wrought iron, steel, or something even more exotic like titanium or alpacca. — Chris Woodrich (talk) 23:59, 12 August 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nJust to clarify, colour is the perception our brain gives to a very specific wavelength of light that is emitted from the object. That wavelength is constant in nature, and does not require a human to be there for it to have that wavelength. So colour is not entirely an illusion, but an objective physical property subjectively interpreted. All that to say that colour is important and adds encyclopaedic value.

Charlesjsharp (talk) 07:35, 11 March 2022 (UTC)[reply]\n@Charlesjsharp: Thing is, it's not like we're seeing the edges of the photo here. Simply cropping a scan could have removed that much if it wasn't done carefully. There's often more vagueness in where a photo starts than you'd think: Text written on the negative, uneven borders, trying to crop out a rip or fading that could have been easily fixed, and so on. I tend to go for as much of the original content as possible, but scans by archives can be... surprisingly strange. This, for example is an actual scan from the University of Pennsylvania archives. Similarly, what's the correct crop on the current Billy Bowlegs image? I went with one that seemed roughly guided by the paper, but books have gutters on one side for where the paper goes into the spine, so I didn't exactly use the paper edges as a guide, as that would have uncentred the text, which is very much not the artistic intent. Now, I can't check the IWM site - it's down - so I can't say if they have a copy of a scan that shows more of the edge that was expanded here, or evidence that this is the intentional crop, but this feels well within the range of acceptable.  Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 7.6% of all FPs 16:46, 12 March 2022 (UTC)[reply]\n@Charlesjsharp: Right. IWM is back up. If you look at the second copy after you click through you'll see it has substantially more headroom, with what may be a crop line about where we have it here, whereas the third copy is similar to the original.

Source for the 16th century says \"example of the work of 17th-century Spanish goldsmiths\" but also that \"the little cross supported by the orb, the earliest part of the confection, probably dates from the 16th century.\" Sources seem to agree on this being a 17th-century work, despite the oldest piece presumably dating to a year before the 17th century.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 00:30, 8 March 2017 (UTC)[reply]\nHmm.  Even that source says it dates partly from the 16th century.  It just seems problematic to me that we have an article caption saying \"It dates, at least partly, to the 17th century\" for the lead image of an article whose lead describes the item as \"Originating — at least partly — in the 16th century\".While these aren't technically contradictory, I'd suggest that one needs revising; and that it would be better to achieve consensus at the article rather than in an image caption.  Personally I'd still support the \"at least partly to the 16th century\" wording - the point is that the crown is traditionally dated to the 16th century, but Christies say it only dates partly from then - i.e. everyone agrees it has an origin in the 16th century, but not exactly how much of the current structure dates back to then.I also think this phrasing would normally be used to give the earliest date - it would be technically true to say \"The Tower of London, which dates at least partly from the 21st century\", but I don't think anyone would.

Adam Cuerden (talk) 07:16, 8 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nNo, there is no counterfoil involved in these notes. The margins could be better but these early notes could have anywhere from nearly perfect to horrendous margins. The redeeming factors are the marbled paper acquired by Franklin: it was only used for partial runs of two issues of currency- the present and the Continental Currency $20. It also grades choice uncirculated. Sadly, there are some who would trim margins to have a more \"even\" appearance...-Godot13 (talk) 18:20, 8 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWhile that might make sense for an engraving in a book or something, where the funny margins aren't really part of the artwork, why would you do that for currency?! Adam Cuerden (talk) 00:44, 9 August 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThe \"rationale\" is that even, level margins improve the eye-appeal (and usually the value) of the note.

It's certainly an arresting image qua image, but I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at, or why the water in one half of the image appears to be frozen while the other half is not. I like the photo, and I could imagine hanging it on my wall, but because it borders on the abstract and is so hard to interpret, I'm skeptical about its EV, and I don't think it should be the infobox image in the article on the reserve.

The very high ISO setting is an inexplicable major technical error (even people who are new to high-end photography know not to do this, especially as there's no reason to do so with when using an excellent camera such as the Canon EOS 5D Mark II in a studio), and renders the photo blury at anything less than thumbnail size.

Nick-D (talk) 10:38, 1 August 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nI largely agree with you about the image quality, but I don't think this was taken in a studio. It was taken with a 300mm lens and 1/200th of a second at ISO 3200. Anything ISO significantly less than that would probably result in camera shake.

Of the ones in Montana (two museums) I've seen many up close, multiple times (in fact, some of the much-lower quality image on wiki are photos I took of the actual art using a cheap camera and existing light with no tripod... meh); the Christmas greeting, for example, is on very weathered material, time has faded it. You may want to download and compare the PowerPoint of the Russell images at this link, which I think are better-quality scans and more accurately portray his range. The Russell palette is unique; his best work portrays the light of the Montana landscape with considerable accuracy (as those of us who live here know...) some have even dubbed his use of light in his oils as \"Charlie Russell light.\" Montana is a dry state, but it's not a washed-out desert — that's one of the big differences between Russell and the less-talented but better-known Remington (whose work was more typical of the southwest).  ;-)  Montanabw(talk) 20:42, 1 January 2016 (UTC)[reply]",

In 1906, what now is Lido Isle (then originally a sandbar), it was incorporated as part of the City ofNewport Beach. The Pacific Electric Railway Company’s \"Red Car Line\" from Los Angeles to Balboa was completed at that time, as well, helping make Newport Bay a popular vacation spot. The railway sold off surplus right-of-way land in 1923, and what was to becomeLido Isle, Newport Beach(then Huntington Island, before that Electric Island) was sold for $45,000 to oilman W.K. Parkinson for development as a commercial shipyard. After dredging the island up to about 11 feet above the mean high tide line, his commercial project never materialized, and in 1928, the land was purchased by an investment group headed by developer William Clarke Crittenden. Crittenden, along with Swiss architect Franz Herding, envisioned a plan for developing Lido as a Mediterranean-themed residential resort area, patterned—and named—after the famous Lido of Venice, a beautiful (and one of Europe’s most fashionable at the time) resort on Italy’s Adriatic coast.",

      "Comment Diagrams can be very useful, and this one shows the structure nicely, but is too much simplified. For instance the clearance in the middle is 8.8m whereas at the shore is 5.5m, thus the base line is not horizontal. This is clearly visible in all the pictures, but misrepresented here. The diagram should also indicate the unit of measurement as \"metres\" to avoid confusions, as the article often indicates dimensions in feet.

Also, there are a lot of spurious pixels in the background area. Janke | Talk 07:41, 4 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nAbsolutely, thank you. I'll cook something up really nice. It's comical because I didn't zoom in, and while these images are heavier in general, I thought it was cleaner than it is. There is something I like about the pixelation as is when you zoom in, it's electric. For our purposes something cleaner  is naturally needed. Radlrb (talk) 08:49, 4 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Comment – Radlrb, for me the main issue is the 250x250 pixel size. It's good enough for infobox, but I like to see something bigger, say 500x500 pixels or larger when I open the image in its own window. I will support if that's done. Bammesk (talk) 15:34, 4 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nWill do! I might not get to it by the 13th, if so I'll renominate once it is cleaned. I might modernize it slightly too. TY Radlrb (talk) 02:18, 5 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Comment – I agree with Bammesk, I was thinking the same. Please consider that 250×250 looks tiny on high dpi displays. I wouldn't go under 500×500 pixels and stay above if possible. I wonder if the movement could be smoother, too, and if the colours can be reworked to look prettier. Thank you :) --Lion-hearted85 (talk) 16:41, 4 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nI'll address all of these : ) Hopefully in time! tyvm Radlrb (talk) 02:18, 5 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nYou could actually remove this nomination and load a new one when you're ready, so you'd get the full time for votes on the new one. --Janke | Talk 13:38, 6 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Comment. Normally I would automatically support this sort of eye-catching and informative geometry visualization. But the parent article is so badly sourced and packed with what appears to be original research (like so many of our polyhedron articles) that I can't bring myself to do so. It's not even obvious to me that the topic is notable: you can place any number of copies of a tetrahedron rotated around one of its axes; what makes this choice of an axis and number of copies special? Do any sources specifically address this shape, not merely mentioning it without depth as an example of a more general construction? —David Eppstein (talk) 03:05, 7 February 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nWell, this is not the place to discuss such a topic, I would rather discuss that in the talk page, rather than here. It's notable because, it is a uniform compound, and the third of its class, if you'd like a quick answer. You know. Ah, that article is not badly sourced, and has zero OR, you must not know the material well, I suggest you read it. And you are also over-generalizing. Thank you for your input. P.S.: In depth, this compound has only been studied for what it is, just another example. Is it yet known to be applicable somehow? Yes, in a sense, in that it is the double compound of the stella octangula, which is self-dual. So for that reason alone it is notable. This doesn't need to be explicitly stated anywhere since it is common sense and explained by Coxeter and many others, however you seem to not have caught that yet?

A theory of this effect was later developed within the framework of Einstein's special relativity theory by Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank, who also shared the Nobel Prize.",

And the boys in the background are absolutely perfect: they suggest an almost universal (if stereotypical) truth about boys and the educational process (I think I see myself in the kid in the orange shirt in the front row here).   This image meets all the technical requirements (yes?); the criticisms based on composition don't hold up against what I see as a dramatic, eye-capturing moment in the lives of a group of children.

This picture of Rossini, stomping a violin, with a magpie singing along to his tunes, and with the works ofDomenico Cimarosaand Mozart being ground under the feet of his followers is great for showing the other side (however wrong it may be). It's one of those things that may not be widely useable, but certainly adds a lot where it is used.",

      "Oppose I will echo the sentiment above, I'm not seeing the EV. A featured picture for the Rossini article should be a portrait of Rossini. Mattximus (talk) 23:04, 21 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\n@Mattximus: That's really limiting the scope of material covered in a soon-to-be-featured article. Are we really going to insist that no picture other than the main image can be featured, and doom them all to being rather bad thereby, because no-one puts in the work on anything but the lead? We have a featured picture of Rossini. But that shouldn't preclude other illustrative content, that helps illustrate and explain key parts of the article. This picture has been discussed in academic biographies of Rossini. Hence why the File Description page has a reference to one.  Adam Cuerden (talk)Has about 6.3% of all FPs 06:15, 22 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI suppose I view Featured Pictures in a very encyclopedic way. If there was an article on Rossini in a physical encyclopedia, what would be the best image of him to best compliment the article? I almost always oppose, say, two images of the exact same bird on the same ground. That's the key difference between wiki commons and featured pictures on wikipedia I think. Nevertheless I can see supporting a second picture for an article but only if it offers significant encyclopedic value (outside of a cathedral and inside a cathedral, or male and female bird, etc..). But that's just my opinion, I'm happy to hear others. Mattximus (talk) 12:29, 22 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nI just want to add that even though we may disagree on the EV of this particular image, I do greatly appreciate what you have done with the images on wikipedia, your efforts have made it a much better website. Mattximus (talk) 00:54, 26 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nLikewise going to strongly disagree with this oppose rationale, per the reasons I described on the talk page. Since when is the most encyclopedic thing about an artist their personal appearance? Best thing for the infobox, sure, but their notability comes from their output and its reception, most of the article is about their output and its reception, and I would fully expect an illustration of what most of the article is about to qualify for FP. ...That's my main concern -- that it depict something covered in some nontrivial way in the article (or that would comprise a nontrivial amount of the article if it were an FA). And that is also why, unfortunately, while I wouldn't oppose it, I don't feel like I can support in this case -- because this doesn't look to be mentioned at all in the article (unless I'm missing something), and I don't know enough about the subject to base support on what should be in the article... would likely support for FP on Commons if I saw it, though. — Rhododendrites talk \\\\ 23:43, 23 February 2019 (UTC)[reply]"

If anything, there's a predominance of it; all of my MET uploads (which include the whole canvas, meaning they're not cropped to straight lines), for instance, have the MET's standard black background (though cropped very tightly, such that it may not be evident at thumbnail). I don't see a need to standardize, for two reasons. First, when we do the cut-out or color change ourselves, it's very easy to introduce inaccuracies (color fringing, etc.) and technical issues (overly jagged/sharp cutouts being my pet peeve). Second, different paintings will have different needs. A very bright painting would probably do poorly on a white background, and a very dark painting (An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump comes to mind) would probably do poorly on a black background. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 15:47, 12 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]",

      "Comment. Not convinced that the sky is realistic looking, particularly on the left side. To my eye, it looks like the tonality is too compressed, a typical issue when reducing highlights too far. Looking at the file description, it's helpful to see your processing workflow, and I'm not sure that it was the best way to do it. I wouldn't rate PTGui's ability to tone map to be honest. I use PTGui to create an HDR file but I always re-import the HDR file back into Lightroom to tone map. Lightroom is better and gives you much more control over things. Given that this isn't true HDR, I don't see any need to use PTGui for anything other than stitching. All tone mapping processing can and should be done in Lightroom prior to stitching. Other than that though, the composition has merit and I don't want to oppose when an improvement in processing could be achieved. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 19:17, 16 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThanks, Diliff for your always very insightful reviews and I acknowledge the critique of workflow. Just some details though: The sources images looked very dull at default import settings, and I was very pessimistic regarding the potential outcome. The sky was much more exposed than the ground, which was mostly in shadow, and there was very little structure in the sky and hardly any details in the vegetation, and colors of the gravel were dull. I therefore elaborately and dramatically pre-processed the images prior to export in 16-bit tiff to PTGui Pro to basically spread out the histogram instead of having it piled up at the ends. (Highlights: -100(!), shadows: +40, contrast: -30 (yes, negative, to get midtone tails into the middle), increased clarity +30 and vibrance +15. In addition, I applied a graduated filter in the sky to further increase the contrast here and bring the exposure down). Not an optimal place for the graduated filer as it were handheld photos. Thus, the alignment from picture to picture was not perfect, but I prioritized this to feed in the most optimal dynamic range in the stitching process. I had exhausted my adjustment possibilities in the source images in Lightroom, which is why I then used the pseudo-HDR tone-mapping in PTGui to further bring out some details. Yes, I could maybe have skipped this in PTGui and have waited with the final stitched tiff and do another cirle in Lightroom. I did some final minor tweaks in Lightroom, such as quite aggressively denoise the sky with an adjustment brush leaving out the, I think, seven flock of migrating birds and also downsample some to get rid of some pretty severe noise. It was a long, iterative process of re-exporting the source images, stitch, twaek the PTGui HDR, tweak further in Lightrrom again, and I am very hesitant to give it another go. So, yes, maybe the sky to the left has too compressed colors due to dramatic lowering of highlights if viewed at full resolution. My main priority has been to give it wow and impact, not to make a color-calibrated representation of the photos that scattered on my sensor that evening:-). And if reviewers find I have been bending reality too much, I certainly respect if this leads to an oppose. -- Slaunger (talk) 20:28, 17 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI'm not sure what the problem is with the sky being much more exposed than the foreground. This is normal. ;-) I think you could have rescued the highlights in the sky without making them as murky as you did. I appreciate that you don't want to start the processing again from scratch. I've been there, done that, and it's not fun. Especially when you fix one problem and accidentally introduce another! It's images like these that I'd love to get a hold of the original RAW files and see what I can weave out of it. Perhaps I'd end up with an image no better than this one anyway, and I also appreciate that photographers can be a bit possessive with their images (not to mention their artistic decisions). Ðiliff «» (Talk) 23:11, 17 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nDiliff: I do not mind giving access to the raws, if you or someone else wants to give it a try;-). Let me look into that tomorrow. Is there a recommended way to share raws for Commons files? I seem to recall Dcoetzee setup an archive server at some point... --Slaunger (talk) 23:35, 17 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI usually just use Dropbox or something. It's easy enough to just zip them up and send a Dropbox link (by email if you prefer). Ðiliff «» (Talk) 23:54, 17 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nDiliff Dropbox it is then! You or any other Commons user may give it a try. Please read the text file for conditions of use and some practical information. It is actually dng files (Digital Negative) (raw + metadata of my pre-processing edits in one file, instead of separate raw and xml sidecar files), so remember to reset the Develop settings if you want to start out with a clean sheet of paper. Looking forward to hearing what you can get out of it. -- Slaunger (talk) 17:18, 18 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nOK, I've had a go and although it was a challenging image to work with (you're right, the final image is significantly different to the 'raw product'), I think I've managed to improve the tonality while remaining reasonably faithful to your original artistic intention. There are differences though, and I'm not sure whether you will consider them improvements. Significantly, the sky is crisper and lighter and with a cooler white balance (I felt this was looked more natural but as I wasn't there, I can only guess). The forest in the background is less contrasty and greener. The gravel pit itself is fairly similar, although less saturated and again with a cooler white balance. The gravel seemed very pinkish in the original. The foreground bushes are a bit darker, greener and more contrasty. I didn't intentionally make them look greener, but I felt the original was a little washed out and the colours of the bushes suffered as a result. Finally, I was able to (with a bit of content aware fill) recover a more of the sky which reduced the aspect ratio a little (which is why it looks less wide). I usually try to maximise the height of panoramas when possible because a very wide panorama can be awkward to view and use. Slaunger, let me know if there's anything you're not happy with. I still have everything set up and ready to make minor adjustments if you think it could be improved. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 19:19, 18 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nDiliff: WOW, just WOW! This is a significant improvement, and I am impressed, considering the not so promising source images. The color is better on the gravel. The content aware fill is an improvement to the aspect ratio. The colors and texture of the fore- and background vegetation is improved. The sky is good. You have even managed to get out, I think, most of the many flocks of migrating birds in the sky. Your sky is more realistic than mine in the left side, although I think my more yellow right end gives a more cool gradient in the sky. Thanks, Thanks, THANKS! -- Slaunger (talk) 19:43, 18 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nGlad you liked the processing! I wasn't sure if it was going to be to your tastes. I realised that I didn't mask the blurry frame as completely as you did, so I might upload a new version over the top of it with the blurriness minimised as much as possible. I could easily adjust the white balance of the sky on the right side of the frame if you prefer, but it would also have the effect of making the blue sky a bit less accurate. I'm not sure what this means for the image in terms of your featured/quality pictures on the original image though. If you're happy with my version then it would make sense to overwrite the original, but the evaluation of the FP/QI was done on the older version. How do you feel about that? Ðiliff «» (Talk) 08:28, 19 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nIf Slaunger agrees it is an improvement then I don't personally see any merit in retaining two separate files on Commons, nor for Commons FP to refer to the weaker one (should everyone agree on that). You could post on the talk page of Commons FP to see if this has community approval without the hassle of a full delist/replace. -- Colin°Talk 08:40, 19 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nTrue. I suppose it's up to Slaunger as for how he wants to handle it. It's his image and his FP/QI, I just made some adjustments. Also, I've just uploaded a new version of the edit 1 image over the top of it. It contains a number of improvements (including a warmer sky on right side as per Slaunger's suggestion). Ðiliff «» (Talk) 09:32, 19 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nPersonally, I would not mind simply overwriting my original nomination with Diliffs edit. It is potentially controversial though according to Commons policy on overwriting files with FP status. I have therefore requested permission over at COM:FPC to get a few nods. Else, I do not think it is a big problem to keep both either, as the preferences for featured status varies a bit between EN:FPC (faithful-oriented) and COM:FPC (wow-oriented). It is seen before. -- Slaunger (talk) 17:10, 19 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nDiliff and Colin After thinking about it and also seeing the reponse on Commons, I do not think you should overwrite my original. Just keep them separate. It will help maintain transparency in seeing the sequence of events with my original followed by Diliffs edit being linked together as 'other versions'. Also, I will follow the replace and delist process on Commons to see if there is consensus there to switch over to the edit. From the very positive response on the edit that seems likely for the time being. -- Slaunger (talk) 21:50, 19 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Support I agree with Diliff that the sky processing isn't ideal (per my Commons review) but not troubling enough for me to oppose a scene with such wow. Btw, Diliff did you mean to write \"All tone mapping processing can and should be done in Lightroom prior to stitching.\" (my emphasis). I worry that since the global adjustment sliders are in fact content-aware tonemapping controls, there is a risk of tonal variation among segments even if settings are sychronised -- though whether this happens in practice I don't know. Not sure there is a huge difference to delaying tonemapping till afterwards if one is dealing with 16-bit tiffs as intermediate files. Can't comment on PtGui vs Lightroom's tonemapping abilities, though. -- Colin°Talk 13:11, 17 November 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

But, in Aida, it illustrates the section on other notable 19th century performanes - which it certainly depicts - and thus has much higher EV and illustrative value. It's also the only image of Verdi in that article, increasing the EV furher. I'm certainly not against it being in Giuseppe Verdi, of course, but only if it's appropriate.

      "Comment The retouching probably went a bit too far compared to LoC's original where colors are more vibrant (since it's a color film I assume the colors are the real ones). The faces, for example, are pale and whitened akin to geishas. Brandmeistertalk 13:18, 5 September 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nIt isn't colour film, is it? I was sure this was a hand-coloured black-and-white image which is why the palette and grading is so limited and half the people and objects are still in monochrome. Admittedly the LOC seem to be claiming that this is colour film but surely they have their heads up a place their heads shouldn't be. Whether the colours need adjusting is another question; I'd say probably not as stupid unrealistic colours are part of the glory of hand-colouring. Belle (talk) 23:14, 5 September 2015 (UTC)[reply]\n@Belle and Brandmeister: The LoC often uses high-quality colour film as a proxy towards certain scans - take a photo of the object, scan the photo. Adam Cuerden (talk) 12:00, 6 September 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nThat could be the case... but it's a slightly confusing file description in that case.

This is done, of course, to \"correct\" the distortion of perspective cause by the lens, and a single, viewpoint. The problem with this is that the human eye expects to see vertical perspective as well as horizontal perspective. In other words, the scale-reduction that you see when you look towards the end of the hall, also happens when you look upwards.",

Personally, I'd rather like it in B&W. And anyway, at least some cleaning is needed, which I did here: File:Albert Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg.

For the copyright, I agree with Coat of Many Colours below. It was most probably published in 1921, and even if published later, most probably without a notice. And even if published with a notice, it is most probable that the copyright was not renewed. I think we are safe enough on that ground. Yann (talk) 17:44, 6 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nStriked my comment. It seems the situation has changed. Yann (talk) 07:55, 8 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Support original or Alt1 (prefer Alt1) I think the proposed version is worth supporting. The original appears to be this at the Austrian National Library and I've added a link to the Commons description. I agree with Yann I prefer B&W. A crop of this image previously failed Featured because the nomination was spoilt by socking. This is an iconic  photo of Einstein as an old man which is Featured. I certainly think we should have the younger one as a foil. Coat of Many Colours (talk) 14:53, 6 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWhat we need is proof of publication before 1923, because otherwise this may be in copyright in the US. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 14:55, 6 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nIt's been around on Commons a long time. On Commons it's accepted that date of publication is taken to be date of creation unless otherwise known to be the case, simply because of the difficulty in establishing a date of publication. Even were it known to be published after 1923 it would still be quite likely PD in the US because in all likelihood it wasn't published in compliance with US formalities,  although there may be URAA issues. For example Commons:File:Albert Einstein Head cleaned.jpg above was copyrighted in 1947 but not renewed, so LoC take the view its PD. Why can't we just take the PD status of Commons Files on trust? It's their job to vet the status of their images. Plainly in blatant cases of copy vios which have escaped attention we should intervene, but otherwise it seems to me that we should just mind our own business and let them mind theirs. Coat of Many Colours (talk) 20:18, 6 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\n@Crisco 1492:--will this do any good Crisco for the date? They say 1921..The herald 15:01, 6 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThat unfortunately only establishes the date of creation. The Berne convention stipulate date of publication, which essentially means making it avilable to the public for copying. However by 1921 Albert Einstein was amongst the most celebrated physicists of his age. It's likely this image was published at the same time (as a book cover perhaps). I don't suppose it was a family snap (I rather doubt he did those). Coat of Many Colours (talk) 16:08, 6 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI'd still like to see proof of publication. Otherwise, I sadly have to oppose for now. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 00:22, 7 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nComment Well, that's very disappointing and sets a bad precedent (if that's indeed what it is, is it?) for the forum. I'm not being obstructive when I say it's a real issue at Commons and that matter of factly policy is to accept date of creation as date of publication. I've been there with this debate: see my gripe  about my tribulations over copyright issues as a nooby editor, where precisely this is raised. This worth quoting from that I think:",

Adam Cuerden (talk) 02:46, 7 July 2014 (UTC)[reply]\n@Adam Cuerden: How do you know that the original in in sepia tone? Additionally, I think it isn't even really sepia. It looks more yellow to me.

His studies were discovered in 2001 and sold to the Austrian National Library.

He was to die of syphilis in 1883, some six month after the death of Cassatt's sister Lydia.Berthe Morisot, subject ofa celebrated portrait by Manet, was with him at the end, writing to her sister \"These last days were very painful; poor Édouard suffered atrociously.

Ultimately, the Zimmerman Telegram would prove to a be a propaganda piece for the United States, as Mexico had determined that it was both unnecessary and unwise to intervene in the war as a Central Powers nation, all the more so since the German Empire could not guarantee sufficient funding to support an independent Mexican national bank and the territory the German Empire had thought to return to Mexican control had by this point been infested with U.S. Citizens, most of whom possessed firearms of some kind and had no trouble putting said weaponry to use in the event of a Mexican reconquest.",

Besides, this category seems too biased towards modern, Western sculpture.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by Blorgy555 (talk • contribs) 13:20, 12 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nThe problem is not that there are already two pictures of Korean sculptures. The problem is that there are already two featured pictures which are used to illustrate exactly the same thing as what this image ostensibly is meant to do (i.e. Korean Buddhist sculpture and National Treasures of South Korea). This means that it has little EV (= Encyclopedic Value); the image of this statue adds very little that the others don't. If there were an article on the statue, I wouldn't be opposing, as we cannot illustrate such a subject with pictures of other statues. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 15:39, 12 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]\nYour points are noted. Still, I think that this has good EV because it was made over a century later in a completely different time period from the other two (they were made in the Three Kingdoms Period while this one was made in the Unified Silla period), it is listed in a different portion of the Korean Buddhist sculpture page, which is quite long, from the other two, it portrays a different Buddha (Amitabha as opposed to Maitreya), it is done in a completely different style (Seated Buddha as opposed to Pensive Bodhisattva), it is only 12 cm tall as opposed to the other two which are both close to 1 metre tall and it is gold, rather than bronze. Also, the Korean Buddhist sculpture article does spend about half a paragraph on this sculpture. Blorgy555 (talk)\nIf there's enough referencing for half a paragraph, there's probably enough referencing for a whole article. Notability shouldn't be a big issue; it is a national treasure of Korea, after all. As I said earlier, if this statue had its own article (and thus its EV wasn't compromised by the existence of two other FPs), I wouldn't be opposing; I'd be supporting. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 23:45, 12 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]",

Encyclopedias don't just use pictures of obscure people... Mattximus (talk) 23:57, 11 September 2017 (UTC)[reply]\nAs Matt said. Also, we're fortunate that some people donate/make available images like this, and that one or two editors are regularly in positions to take pictures themselves. Highlighting some of these images (that meet our standards, obviously) offers an incentive for further donations. — Chris Woodrich (talk) 00:48, 13 September 2017 (UTC)[reply]"

So if you replaced the image and it stayed for a week, it just means that no one saw it or cared enough to contest it, not that everyone agrees that the replacement is superior. Not sure what the best solution to this dilemma is, however. -- King of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠ 04:59, 3 June 2020 (UTC)[reply]\nThe nominator can put their preferred image in the article, wait a few weeks, then nominate it if no-one objected. If no editors saw it on the article, nothing is lost; but we shouldn't really be making decisions about article content here, away from the editors of those articles. Similar alternatives coming up during the nomination process has been long accepted as part of the process - though if they don't then find a place in an article, they should be nominated for delisting; but I'm uncomfortable with a nomination where the preferred option is an image not in an article. Ultimately, Featured Picture Candidates exists to serve Wikipedia, not vice versa: FPC is here to recognise images that bring value to the encyclopedia, the encyclopedia is not here to display images FPC thinks are beautiful. TSP (talk) 11:04, 6 June 2020 (UTC)[reply]\nPerhaps the nominator can put the new image in the article, and if no one objects, then it represents implicit consent of the community to use either of the two images. Then it would be fair game to have FPC decide IMO, even if the original image is technically no longer used in the article. -- King of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠ 15:09, 6 June 2020 (UTC)[reply]"

      "Comment - I don't think the resolution is a big deal. I don't think it makes sense to consider it an animation, but it's true that the reason for that minimum is most connected to photo quality. Nobody would expect a, say, 12 megapixel screenshot. What we want is for it to be a high-quality representation of what something really looks like. That takes more pixels for most photographic subjects, and if we somehow had a 12 MP screenshot it would not actually look like the thing being depicted. My question is about the layout. It's been a long time since I've used GNOME, I would much more expect a typical desktop screen, with icons, etc. and maybe one window open, rather than every bit of space taken up by open programs. I don't know. It seems like a really hard thing for FPC. I don't think it matters at all if people looking at the main page don't know what it is.

      "Comment - Looks a little underexposed, I think. You may need some post-processing. Also concerned about the players' legs in the background. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 01:22, 10 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWhat do you mean by underexposed. What about this photo points toward that assessment? How do you post-process a correction?--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 07:37, 10 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThe floors at BBall courts are usually very, very, shiny, owing to the amount of polish. Here it has a very matte look. That being said... I'm concerned by the noise in this image. His skin is not very smooth; looks like noise. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 08:13, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI suppose noise stems from my use of a monopod rather than a tripod and the fact that I shot at 800 ISO/640 speed in manual mode. FWIW, auto settings for the action setting in this lighting were 1600 ISO/1250 speed when I tested the action setting on the mode dial. Given that I am working with a Rebel T4i, I can't do much better in terms of noise.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 11:44, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI suppose from the angle the image was taken from, there wasn't any reflection. I also agree that it's slightly darker than is ideal. All the whites in the image are dull greys. But I'm more concerned that it's not a true 'action shot'. Obviously, he's actually dunking the ball, but the absence of any defence in the image makes it look a bit staged. A 'demonstration duck' if you will, and not taken during an actual game. I appreciate that it's somewhat of a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation to be in though. If there were a lot of other players in the shot, it would be opposed for messy composition! Ðiliff «» (Talk) 09:37, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nIf you look at the history, you can see that I cropped out the other players in the shot.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 11:26, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nVisually, I am not sure what you mean by the whites not being very white. When I look at the word McDonald's on his shirt, that looks about as white as I could have hoped for, IMO. However I see what you are saying in the image brightness histogram. The brightness histogram of the original shot is sort of bimodal with a low peak very close to the left and a higher peak two thirds of the way to the right. There is almost no content in the right quartile of the histogram. I am shocked to see no content in the right quartile of the image histogram. I thought the whites were white, but I see your point.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 11:44, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nLooking at the image brightness histograms of all the images that I have uploaded from this game, the only ones with white whites are the non-action ones shot in fully automode. File:20140402 MCDAAG Justin Jackson Jack Daly Award (2).JPG seems to have the best histogram in terms of having white whites without notable spikes going off the chart. File:20140402 MCDAAG MVPs (2).JPG is also decent. However these are at 500 and 400 speeds so they would have more blur in the action shots.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 12:00, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nP.S. even in  the game-winning dunk (File:20140402 MCDAAG Jahlil Okafor game-winning dunk (2).JPG) by the same player, it does not look like anyone is trying to stop him. So having other players in the shot does not make it look like any more of an action shot in some senses.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 12:25, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nOK, you've convinced me that it's just an unfortunate angle that makes it appear that he's completely uncontested. But as for the brightness, perhaps your monitor needs an adjustment because the whites on Jahlil's shirt are not particularly bright. I've made an image which shows the original next to an edit I quickly put together for comparison, and I think it improves on the exposure somewhat. I would say that perhaps the court appears slightly overexposed in the edit (I'm not sure what it looked like 'in person'), but the darker tones of the player's skin and shirt are more what I would expect to see. I suppose it's a tricky scene for the camera to meter. The court is bright and the player is dark. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 13:00, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nActually, looking through my files, some of the actions shots with the same settings have significant white whites presence in the histogram. I am going to spend time looking at more images. I like your processing of the whites however. Can you post that edit here for consideration.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 13:58, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nDone. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 14:41, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI don't know what to say about whether the court is overexposed or depicts the true appearance in the edit. This picture is now a 53.5% crop of a 200m zoom image. We are talking about what the court would look like if I had 20-25x zoom vision in comparison to my regular eyesight. I was not down on the court and don't know its true color.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 20:24, 11 April 2014 (UTC)--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 03:18, 12 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nNot that it really matters what 'zoom level' it was taken at, but I think 20-25x is an exaggeration. You shot it at 200mm with a crop-sensor camera, meaning a full frame equivalent of 320mm. The human eye's focal length is apparently 22-24mm, but it's not a direct equivalent to a camera lens because the eye is really nothing like a camera lens/sensor, and you only really see clearly in the central 3-5% of your vision. It gets progressively worse the wider it goes. 50mm is considered to be roughly equivalent to the 'sharp' part of our vision though. So going with 50mm, 320mm is really only about 6x 'zoom'. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 22:38, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThen this is cropped so we are looking at about 12X right? Regardless, I don't know what a court should look like. Crisco 1492 seemed to know what the floor should look like.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 23:20, 11 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWe're getting a bit caught up in the details now, but different courts look different. They're usually all shiny and waxed though, but the colour and luminosity depends on the wood used to build it, I'd imagine. So unless Crisco has actually been to that particular court, I don't think he'd be any more accurate than you are. If you think it looks fine, let's go with that? In any case, I'm not sure it's going to be a featured picture... The image quality isn't quite there. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 00:19, 12 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI can't vouch for this exact court (my only experience with Chicago thusfar has been O'Hare, and that was a combined total of 6 hours), but I think Diliff's edit has the colors a bit more as one would expect a BBall court. That being said, the noise is still significant... once I'm done tweaking my new panorama of Sari Temple, I'll see what this looks like if we denoise it and downsample, see if it can be made featureable or not. Composition wise this is decent, although I think a more direct shot (i.e. from a lower row) might have more \"oomph\". But then, I'd expect one's mobility with a camera to be limited in such a setting, so I wouldn't think too much of that. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 02:29, 12 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nOf course an event like this at the United Center is reserved seating. I had a ticket for section 319, which shares an entrance with section 318. In section 318, there is what appears to be a standing room area where I set up.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 03:18, 12 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI was playing with the image in Lightroom, and with Luminescence at 30 (maybe as high as 40) the image is considerably smoother. However, I don't think the loss of detail would be a good trade off. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 00:28, 13 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWell, the feedback on this image will greatly improve my photography. You have made me think more clearly about what all the graphs are on my camera. Now, that I have processed that they can tell me if my whites are really white, I will probably choose my settings a lot better. I think almost all the indoor basketball photography that I have done in the past two years has been underdeveloped now that the two of you have coached me to think about whether my images are presenting white whites. Sadly, the images in this set are among my best in terms of being adequately developed. Certainly, something is better than nothing. I am not going to be able to reduce the noise. In action photography as in life, you cannot have speed, quality and affordability. In choosing the Rebel T4i, I have surrendered quality.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 02:35, 13 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nWhat software are you using for processing? Camera Raw and Lightroom are paid software, but they both perform admirably (the \"auto levels\" is a bit too bright for my liking, but you can easily fix that with the software). — Crisco 1492 (talk) 04:36, 13 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "I don't really do much post-processing. I crop in either MS Paint or the Windows 8 Photo app. The Win8 app crops more quickly but is approximate. I might want to retain 3:2, but it might give me a 2401:1600 image instead of 2400:1600 image. Aside from cropping, I don't do much. There was a time when I used Hugin and GIMP fairly regularly, but that has been a few years. Not sure what you mean by \"auto levels\".--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 05:08, 13 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nAh, that explains it; you may need something more powerful for such things as contrast, exposure, highlights, etc. As for the automatic feature: this gives a fairly good overview of Camera Raw. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 06:16, 13 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nAgree with Crisco. You don't necessarily have to use expensive software, but I would recommend using something to ensure that your photo is the best it can be before submitting an image to FPC. Photos are rarely exposed perfectly straight out of camera. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 10:00, 13 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nFor non-expensive software (i.e. free), GIMP offers some possibilities. I don't use it as much as the software I've mentioned above (I mainly use it for circle cropping; GIMP allows one to resize the cut area much more easily than Photoshop), but it is fairly powerful. — Crisco 1492 (talk) 11:20, 14 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]",

      "Oppose - needs restoration. There's also some text on the bottom left that is cut off. MER-C 10:54, 20 September 2020 (UTC)[reply]\n@MER-C: The text is physically cut off in the original, as you can see in the uncropped version. I'm not sure we would want to do a restoration on this as most of the damage is from tears, folds, and stains, rather than dust and scratches that you get on a photograph. Making such substantial alterations might affect the image's role as a verifiable historical document. But I would defer to Adam's opinion on this. Kaldari (talk) 21:52, 22 September 2020 (UTC)[reply]\nLooks like the text is cut off on LOC original too.

I've done this myself for images where the version on the LoC website was sub-standard, e.g. File:The Horse in Motion high res.tiff. This would also jive with the uploader's comment: \"Higher resolution from LoC source\". Unfortunately, the uploader retired many years ago, so we can't find out from them directly.

      "Comment - I'd like to know a lot more about this particular print and its significance. The Brooks illustration was widely-distributed in a wide assortment of versions; the first, by Elford in 1788, seems to have simply been a single plan view with accompanying text (possibly this); this was then added to in a 1789 broadsheet. Many subsequent versions were made, of which this undated version seems to be one. Given it's not in great condition, I'd want some reason to believe it is both a historically-significant printing, and that no copy of this printing in better condition can be found.

My take on the EV: the photo offers excellent views of the wing bars, primary projection, and underside of the bill; the head shape is better shown in the user's other photo of the same bird, File:Eastern wood pewee (71100).jpg, but there the upper parts are blurrier. If I were going to pick a lead image for the article, of the choices available at the Commons, I would probably go with File:Eastern Wood-Pewee (2022).jpg, which doesn't show the wings very well at all, but captures the posture and typical appearnce of the bird in the field better than the nominated photo IMO.

At the moment, I don’t have access to academic databases, nor the money for xeroxing a few articles and chapters I’ve consulted over the years in various art historical, medical, and genealogical libraries, which is only to hint that, without giving away what I’ve found (O yes, it certainly qualifies as “Original Research”, and Wikipedia is no place for that), my ambition is to build a veriably-sourced platform article on Wikipedia, based on existing art historical scholarship about this painting, after which I later publish something elsewhere on my own. But that would not be for me to insert, and all this lays years ahead... But to know who “Frankie” really was, the identity of his (Irish) mother and (non-Irish, but... but...) father, and how this his remarkable story relates to, indeed, the VERY first days of narrative cinema (in what we today call “shorts”, shown in the very first pop-up theaters in the neighborhood of Bellows’ painting studio, many blocks from his actual residence)... To think of the storytelling inherent in the visual medium of film, and all that still to cone in this beave new art form, and the diegetic (“diegetic” being just a fancy word for “story-telling”) qualities of the very first music went with it, wholly improvised (as was so batural to Frankie, from his earliest days at the Harmonium, though in his life he could barely write his name and was never able to read, words or music, almost certainly because of the problem with his eyes, b/c he could not see close-up, but also because he fidgeted so when you tried to put a book in front of him and... well, he was never attentive to anything but...but to ANYTHING but music, and sounds, and the comedy of life all around him that could wake at his tocih) now, all that IS a novel. So when you think of the great film composers later to come, from Nino Rota to John Williams and on and on, so many others, think of their progenitors, and a painter eho had the vision to depict Frankie “in the grand manner”, as a figure of royalty, of honor. Think of where film and music were first married, and the “anonymous” musicians who married them. And bear with me, and with the indulgence of an FA nomination prorogued.

Bammesk (talk) 03:03, 21 December 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nSure, but as I said in the reason, it's a small, newly opened passive use park that's basically open space, a couple paths, and a few remnants of the old amusement park (of which this is the most prominent). There's history, and it's good the land was preserved for public use, but the place is, at this point, fairly unimpressive. I nominated it because I do think it's a pretty good representation of the park.

Here is how I think of the EV in general terms: when I see a photo and it is interesting enough that I want to know more, then is there content on the English Wikipedia to satisfy my curiosity. In this particular case, I see the photo as a depiction of the arch, rather than the park, and the arch is not that notable, and in my opinion not that interesting (based on our content) to have a FP of its own.

PhotoDoc — Preceding unsigned comment added by 198.89.66.135 (talk) 21:00, 23 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nYou need to go back to the original file you downloaded off the camera (hopefully in raw image format) and enter a higher quality setting when you save it as a JPEG. You should aim for a file size of about 3-4 MB or a quality setting of about 97 instead of the <~ 80 you put in. The blocky noise in the background at full resolution (the JPEG artifacts) should disappear. MER-C 21:35, 23 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nThank you for clarifying. Went back to the original raw image and saved it as a higher resolution JPEG. Replaced image, current file size is 6.85 MB. Thank you. PhotoDoc —Preceding undated comment added 22:45, 23 January 2019 (UTC)[reply]\nThe artifacting is gone, but it has unmasked image noise due to your choice of ISO sensitivity. You've got a fairly old entry-level DSLR, which doesn't perform too well at higher ISO settings. A noise correction will help, but I don't know whether it will be enough. For future reference, a shutter speed of 1/800s at ISO 200 and the same f-number yields effectively the same brightness and sharpness but with much less noise.

Moonreach (talk) 18:03, 17 August 2024 (UTC)[reply]\nThat's largely due to the relative rarity of photos before the modern era.

      "Oppose. This picture has been edited from another one, apparently to remove some text naming the peaks. I find that unobjectionable. But there are other editing artifacts that show up as well. The one it was edited from had what looks like a stitching artifact where the mountain background was brighter on one side of a pole in the lower left than on the other side; this has been reduced but not eliminated. And all of the mountain ridgetops have heavy black outlines, probably from too much unsharp mask. The nominator speaks above about blithely cloning out objects visible in scenes (unobjectionable when the subject is a person and the cloning is something irrelevant in background, but more problematic when the subject is the scene itself). Some odd bright red stains on the lower left edge have been replaced with odd grey-brown stains that are harder to spot. It makes me wonder how much more manipulation there is that I am not seeing. But it also makes me skeptical that this image is GA quality. —David Eppstein (talk) 06:07, 17 May 2022 (UTC)[reply]\nThanks for the input. The image has also had some red and blue chromatic aberrations removed, all edits performed by me. I’d just like to point out that removing objects that distract from the scene, correcting stitching errors, etc are routine, uncontroversial fixes.

It is quite possible that Patrick Rothfuss doesn't like that image, and I'm glad that he's decided to release another one under a free license, but there seems to be a number of concerns with the candidate picture. Sven Manguard Wha? 06:21, 2 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThe concerns with the candidate picture are artistic in nature, namely the intentional 'vignette' and a tight crop. These are not technical concerns and not something that bring into question the legitimacy of the image... Remember that opposing a picture here doesn't mean opposing its use in the article, it means opposing it being featured. I don't think the image you reverted back to is better in any case. Ðiliff «» (Talk) 07:15, 2 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI'm with Diliff (and I have reverted you). The combination of the startled look and the fact Mr. Rothfuss is looking away from the text on the old image make it less than ideal, and the fact he himself doesn't like the image is another good reason to prefer this one. Of course, you don't have to pretend it's worse than the previous image to offer a good faith oppose. J Milburn (talk) 08:40, 2 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nI'm not pretending anything. To me, this image is worse than the one that was there before. From an encyclopedic value standpoint, I find this image much less worthwhile. The badly executed pseudo-religious iconography thing makes me loathe to see the image in use in an article. Sven Manguard Wha? 18:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThat's just plain offensive. There's no need to attack the photographer just because he's not here. J Milburn (talk) 20:47, 2 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]\nThat said, I'll assume you are meaning to actually present an argument, so here's why I feel your argument doesn't hold water: I can't see any attempt at any \"pseudo-religious iconography\" in this image, so I am unclear what you feel is badly executed. What I see is a portrait with charm and character, with lighting carefully used to draw the viewer to the subject's face. Others are unsure about that lighting choice, and that seems like a fair concern to have, but it's not a concern I share. As for the other picture: I find the expression less than ideal, and, while the size and good and the background appropriate, I get the impression that the subject was surprised by the photographer. Again, the fact that the subject is less than happy with that image (something which, in the case of a BLP, we have to consider) and the fact that this image faces the text (which is, whatever other users choose to believe, actually mentioned in the MOS) also serve to suggest that it's less than ideal. That one would not have a chance at FPC, yet there have been several users supporting this one here. That, surely, should give you a reason to pause before supporting the use of your preferred image in the article. J Milburn (talk) 20:56, 2 April 2014 (UTC)[reply]",
      "Oppose -- Neither image is perfect but I prefer the other as it seems fresher (if I can use that word), less staged and composed more appropriately.

Some examples:\nNasal cavity bottom should be flat\nUvula or soft palate?\nEpiglottis not labelled\nAbdominal contents quite high, as discussed\nEsophagus should be behind liver, as discussed\nShape of stomach does not show pylorus\nSmall intestine appears to be behind ascending colon\nAtypical labelling of common bile duct, this usually points to the duct above and the ampulla of Vater is usually where the label currently lies\nAscending colon arrow points to the Taenia coli but descending to a haustra.",

      "(E/C) Oppose due to inaccuracies and thus diminished EV, per soupvector and Chris Woodrich. Here are some further concerns:\nThe style is inconsistent. The intestines are shown as exteriors, while the stomach is shown as a hollow cross-section. Furthermore, the stomach's walls are shown in the same colour and confusingly appear continuous with the entire oesophagus and the nasal cavity and phraynx, which are empty spaces. Also, the highlighted colour of the oral cavity loses the fact that it is continuous with the pharynx.\nIt isn't clear what the shading in the liver is supposed to show. At any rate, it doesn't help convey that the gallbladder and bile ducts attach to the \"underside\" of the liver which is to the back. As with the liver/stomach positions, the entire image needs a better way of representing front and behind, not just simply changing the anatomy, which is misleading.\nIf the anatomical distortions are deliberate, in order to show each structure unobscured, this needs to be properly conveyed.\nThe roof of the mouth is far too thick.",
